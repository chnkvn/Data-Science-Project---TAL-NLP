The project has been described as ""web culture articulated as printed artifact,"" an ""archive of archives,"" characterized as an ""accumulation of accumulations,"" much of it printed on demand. Techniques for appropriating web content used by artists in the collection include <i>grabbing</i>, <i>hunting</i>, <i>scraping</i> and <i>performing</i>, detailed by Soulellis in ""Search, Compile, Publish,"" and later referenced by Alessandro Ludovico.</p> <p>Among the 130 artists included in Library of the Printed Web are Olia Lialina, Mishka Henner, Clement Valla, Karolis Kosas, Lauren Thorson, Cory Arcangel, Silvio Lorusso, Angela Genusa, Jean Keller, Aaron Krach, Joachim Schmid, Benjamin Shaykin, Chantal Zakari, Richard Prince, David Horvitz and Penelope Umbrico. Over 240 works are in the collection.

Ashcan comic	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>ashcan comic</b> is a form of the American comic book originally created solely to establish trademarks on potential titles and not intended for sale. The practice was common in the 1930s and 1940s when the comic book industry was in its infancy, but was phased out after updates to US trademark law. The term was revived in the 1980s by Bob Burden, who applied it to prototypes of his self-published comic book. Since the 1990s, the term has been used to describe promotional materials produced in large print runs and made available for mass consumption. In the film and television industries, the term 'ashcan copy' has been adopted for low-grade material created to preserve a claim to licensed property rights. </p> "	an ashcan comic is a form of the american comic book originally created solely to establish trademarks on potential titles and not intended for sale the practice was common in the 1930s and 1940s when the comic book industry was in its infancy but was phased out after updates to us trademark law the term was revived in the 1980s by bob burden who applied it to prototypes of his selfpublished comic book since the 1990s the term has been used to describe promotional materials produced in large print runs and made available for mass consumption in the film and television industries the term ashcan copy has been adopted for lowgrade material created to preserve a claim to licensed property rights	comic book produced only for legal reasons or promotional preview, rather than for full publication	comic book produced only for legal reasons or promotional preview rather than for full publication	Written_communication

Book	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>book</b> is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical arrangement is <i>codex</i> (plural, <i>codices</i>). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. </p><p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's <i>Physics</i> is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts. </p><p>The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats. </p><p>Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science <i>monograph</i> denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, ""bookworm"". A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.</p>"	a book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images typically composed of many pages made of papyrus parchment vellum or paper bound together and protected by a cover the technical term for this physical arrangement is codex plural codices in the history of handheld physical supports for extended written compositions or records the codex replaces its predecessor the scroll a single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page as an intellectual object a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read in a restricted sense a book is a selfsufficient section or part of a longer composition a usage reflecting that in antiquity long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained each part of aristotles physics is called a book in an unrestricted sense a book is the compositional whole of which such sections whether called books or chapters or parts are parts the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition nor even be called a book books can consist only of drawings engravings or photographs crossword puzzles or cutout dolls in a physical book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries such as in an account book an appointment book an autograph book a notebook a diary or a sketchbook some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects like a scrapbook or photograph album books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any nonserial publication complete in one volume book or a finite number of volumes even a novel like prousts sevenvolume in search of lost time in contrast to serial publications like a magazine journal or newspaper an avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially bookworm a place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries google has estimated that by 2010 approximately 130000000 titles had been published in some wealthier nations the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks	written text that can be published in printed or electronic form	written text that can be published in printed or electronic form	Written_communication
Book restoration	<p><b>Book restoration</b> is the renewal and repair of books. Techniques include cleaning; mending and filling damaged pages; restitching and rebinding. The first substantial work on the subject was Alfred Bonnardot's <i>Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres</i> which was first published in Paris in 1846.

Bookworm (insect)	"<p><b>Bookworm</b> is a general name for any insect that is said to bore through books.</p><p>The damage to books that is commonly attributed to ""bookworms"" is, in truth, not caused by any species of worm. Often, the larvae of various types of insects including beetles, moths and cockroaches, which may bore or chew through books seeking food, are responsible. Some such larvae exhibit a superficial resemblance to worms and are the likely inspiration for the term, though they are not true worms. In other cases, termites, carpenter ants, and woodboring beetles will first infest wooden bookshelves and later feed on books placed upon the shelves, attracted by the wood-pulp paper used in most commercial book production. </p><p>True book-borers are uncommon. The primary food sources for many ""bookworms"" are the leather or cloth bindings of a book, the glue used in the binding process, or molds and fungi that grow on or inside books. When the pages themselves are attacked, a gradual encroachment across the surface of one page or a small number of pages is typical, rather than the boring of holes through the entire book (see images on right).</p><p>The term has come to have a second, idiomatic use, indicative of a person who reads a great deal or to perceived excess: someone who devours books metaphorically. </p>"	bookworm is a general name for any insect that is said to bore through booksthe damage to books that is commonly attributed to bookworms is in truth not caused by any species of worm often the larvae of various types of insects including beetles moths and cockroaches which may bore or chew through books seeking food are responsible some such larvae exhibit a superficial resemblance to worms and are the likely inspiration for the term though they are not true worms in other cases termites carpenter ants and woodboring beetles will first infest wooden bookshelves and later feed on books placed upon the shelves attracted by the woodpulp paper used in most commercial book production true bookborers are uncommon the primary food sources for many bookworms are the leather or cloth bindings of a book the glue used in the binding process or molds and fungi that grow on or inside books when the pages themselves are attacked a gradual encroachment across the surface of one page or a small number of pages is typical rather than the boring of holes through the entire book see images on rightthe term has come to have a second idiomatic use indicative of a person who reads a great deal or to perceived excess someone who devours books metaphorically	common name for any insect which bores through books	common name for any insect which bores through books	Written_communication

Since the 15th century, following the printing revolution, ephemera has been a long-standing element of everyday life.

Although disposability is a recurring and emphasised characteristic of ephemera in virtually all definitions, the quality of paper differs. </p><p>Ephemera has long been collected, with certain instances of ephemera intended to be collected. Victorian families pasted their collections of ephemera in scrapbooks. Hobbyists and institutions were among later collectors.

These collectors steered the decision towards preserving ephemera, which is now ubiquitous in archives and library special collections. </p><p>Ephemera has received academic attention.

Outline (list)	"<p>An <b>outline</b>, also called a <b>hierarchical outline</b>, is a list arranged to show hierarchical relationships and is a type of tree structure. An outline is used to present the main points (in sentences) or topics (terms) of a given subject. Each item in an outline may be divided into additional sub-items. If an organizational level in an outline is to be sub-divided, it shall have at least two subcategories, as advised by major style manuals in current use. An outline may be used as a drafting tool of a document, or as a summary of the content of a document or of the knowledge in an entire field. It is not to be confused with the general context of the term ""outline"", which a summary or overview of a subject, presented verbally or written in prose (for example, <i>The Outline of History</i> is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties. </p><p>A sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus. </p><p>Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof. Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a ""bare outline"". </p><p>Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process. </p><p>A software program designed for processing outlines is called an outliner. </p>"	an outline also called a hierarchical outline is a list arranged to show hierarchical relationships and is a type of tree structure an outline is used to present the main points in sentences or topics terms of a given subject each item in an outline may be divided into additional subitems if an organizational level in an outline is to be subdivided it shall have at least two subcategories as advised by major style manuals in current use an outline may be used as a drafting tool of a document or as a summary of the content of a document or of the knowledge in an entire field it is not to be confused with the general context of the term outline which a summary or overview of a subject presented verbally or written in prose for example the outline of history is not an outline of the type presented below the outlines described in this article are lists and come in several varieties a sentence outline is a tool for composing a document such as an essay a paper a book or even an encyclopedia it is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered and their order of presentation by section topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject arranged in levels and while they can be used to plan a composition they are most often used as a summary such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college courses syllabus outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used or lack thereof many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline to provide a specific path for each item to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed an alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries a decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes an outline without prefixes is called a bare outline specialized applications of outlines also exist a reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work as a revision tool it may show the gaps in the documents coverage so that they may be filled and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work an integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works in which the sources and the writers notes from the sources are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process a software program designed for processing outlines is called an outliner	list arranged to show hierarchical relationships	list arranged to show hierarchical relationships	Written_communication

Book	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>book</b> is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical arrangement is <i>codex</i> (plural, <i>codices</i>). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. </p><p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's <i>Physics</i> is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts. </p><p>The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats. </p><p>Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science <i>monograph</i> denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, ""bookworm"". A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.</p>"	a book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images typically composed of many pages made of papyrus parchment vellum or paper bound together and protected by a cover the technical term for this physical arrangement is codex plural codices in the history of handheld physical supports for extended written compositions or records the codex replaces its predecessor the scroll a single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page as an intellectual object a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read in a restricted sense a book is a selfsufficient section or part of a longer composition a usage reflecting that in antiquity long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained each part of aristotles physics is called a book in an unrestricted sense a book is the compositional whole of which such sections whether called books or chapters or parts are parts the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition nor even be called a book books can consist only of drawings engravings or photographs crossword puzzles or cutout dolls in a physical book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries such as in an account book an appointment book an autograph book a notebook a diary or a sketchbook some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects like a scrapbook or photograph album books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any nonserial publication complete in one volume book or a finite number of volumes even a novel like prousts sevenvolume in search of lost time in contrast to serial publications like a magazine journal or newspaper an avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially bookworm a place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries google has estimated that by 2010 approximately 130000000 titles had been published in some wealthier nations the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks	written text that can be published in printed or electronic form	written text that can be published in printed or electronic form	Written_communication

List of National Treasures of Japan (ancient documents)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The term ""National Treasure"" has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897. The definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. These ancient documents adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, a special body of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, based on their ""especially high historical or artistic value"". ""Ancient documents"" is one of thirteen categories of National Treasures recognized by the agency. The list presents 62 documents or sets of documents from classical to early modern Japan, from the Asuka period to the Meiji period. The actual number of items is more than 62 because groups of related objects have been combined into single entries. The list contains items of various type such as letters, diaries, records or catalogues, certificates, imperial decrees, testaments and maps. The documents record early Japanese government and Buddhism including early Japanese contact with China, the organization of the state and life at the Japanese imperial court. They are housed in 14 Japanese cities in temples (35), museums (13), libraries or archives (6), shrines (4), universities (2) and in private collections (2). Most entries (28) in the list are located in Kyoto. The documents in this list were made predominantly with a writing brush on paper and, in many cases, present important examples of calligraphy.</p><p>Writing was physically introduced to Japan from China in the form of inscribed artefacts at the beginning of the Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as archaeological National Treasures, include coins of the reign of Wang Mang (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound, the Seven-Branched Sword with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century. All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the Japanese. When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorative.</p><p>The concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje in the form of classical Chinese books likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls (<i>kansubon</i>). This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese writing system as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal. Examples include three archaeological National Treasures: Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror from about the 5th century, which is a poor copy of a Chinese original, the Inariyama Sword from 471 or 531 and the Eta Funayama burial mound sword from about the 5th century. The abrupt transition from an unfamiliarity with writing to reading and writing complicated works in a foreign language required the earliest Japanese texts be composed and read by people from the continent such as Wani. The Inariyama Sword is also the oldest example of man'yōgana use, a writing system that employs Chinese characters to represent the Japanese language. Soon after the introduction of writing, scribes were appointed to the provinces to ""record events and report conditions"".</p><p>While writing in Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, the number of documents written locally increased in the 7th century; though most of them have been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to become an integral part of Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the <i>Daigakuryo</i> (""University"") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho (""Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras""), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (<i>shakyōjo</i>) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.</p>"	the term national treasure has been used in japan to denote cultural properties since 1897 the definition and

in china however the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the japanese when the japanese later manufactured locally copies of original chinese mirrors they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorativethe concept of writing came to japan from the korean kingdom of baekje in the form of classical chinese books likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls kansubon this probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century around 400 and certainly during the

Fieldnotes	<p><b>Fieldnotes</b> refer to qualitative notes recorded by scientists or researchers in the course of field research, during or after their observation of a specific organism or phenomenon they are studying. The notes are intended to be read as evidence that gives meaning and aids in the understanding of the phenomenon.

It is best to record fieldnotes while making observations in the field or immediately after leaving the site to avoid forgetting important details. Some suggest immediately transcribing one's notes from a smaller pocket-sized notebook to something more legible in the evening or as soon as possible.

Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, image scanning, or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. Microprint is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by widespread digital methods. </p><p>While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography.

It was added to by many generations, and contained various information: diary-type entries on current events, memoirs, letters, political speeches, copies of legal documents, gossips, jokes and anecdotes, financial documents, economic information (price of grain, etc.), philosophical musings, poems, genealogical trees, advice (agricultural, medical, moral) for the descendants and others.

Some silvae rerum were of truly enormous proportions, with thousands of pages (Gloger cites one of 1764 pages) although most common size is from 500 to 800 pages.

Rash is the first feature-length documentary in Australia to focus on the new art form of street art. </p><p>Filming began in 2002 on this documentary, which conveys the commitment, ideals and beliefs demonstrated in Melbourne street art.

In fact, it is this misconception of the graffiti artist and their role in society that Hansen's film centrally explores. Rash reveals that Melbourne's graffiti subculture is not only a very tight knit community where everyone knows what each other is doing. It is also governed by a set of 'street etiquette'’.</p><p>Prior to its 2006 TV broadcast in Australia Sacha Molitorisz of <i>The Age</i> newspaper reviewed the film saying 'This fresh documentary explores Melbourne's flourishing graffiti subculture.'

Stencil	"<p><b>Stencilling</b> produces an image or pattern by applying pigment to a surface under an intermediate object with designed gaps in it which create the pattern or image by only allowing the pigment to reach some parts of the surface. The <b>stencil</b> is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object; the context in which <i>stencil</i> is used makes clear which meaning is intended. In practice, the (object) stencil is usually a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, wood or metal, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material. </p><p>The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. Although aerosol or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made with the intention of being reused. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil <b>islands</b> (sections of material that are inside cut-out ""holes"" in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with <b>bridges</b> (narrow sections of material that are not cut out). </p><p>Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as <b>pochoir</b>. A related technique (which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions) is aerography, in which spray-painting is done <i>around</i> a three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment. </p><p>Screen printing also uses a stencil process, as does mimeography. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called ""stencils"". Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography, the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images. </p> "	stencilling produces an image or pattern by applying pigment to a surface under an intermediate object with designed gaps in it which create the pattern or image by only allowing the pigment to reach some parts of the surface the stencil is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object the context in which stencil is used makes clear which meaning is intended in practice the object stencil is usually a thin sheet of material such as paper plastic wood or metal with letters or a design cut from it used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cutout holes in the material the key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design although aerosol or painting stencils can be made for onetime use typically they are made with the intention of being reused to be reusable they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface with some designs this is done by connecting stencil islands sections of material that are inside cutout holes in the stencil to other parts of the stencil with bridges narrow sections of material that are not cut out stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as pochoir a related technique which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions is aerography in which spraypainting is done around a threedimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design this technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10000 bc where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects the artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment screen printing also uses a stencil process as does mimeography the masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called stencils stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours during screen printing and mimeography the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multicolored images	thin sheet of material, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface	thin sheet of material with letters or a design cut from it used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface	Written_communication

The marks may form an image or writing.

In archaeology, the term may or may not include the more common modern sense of an ""unauthorized"" addition to a building or monument.

Moss graffiti	<p><b>Moss graffiti</b> is a type of street art that uses living moss to write on the walls of public spaces. The art is made by growing moss on mats, cutting it into shapes and gluing it to a wall. By replacing the harmful chemicals found in paints (such as methanol, which damages the nervous system when consumed in large quantities) with plant matter, the artist can still create works without damaging the environment. After application, the moss grows, adding a new dimension to the art medium as well as extending the concept of guerrilla gardening. </p><p>There are many fake videos and articles online that claim moss graffiti can be created in a blender. They claim by taking clumps of moss and blending them with water (sometimes beer), buttermilk, yogurt, and corn syrup you can create a thick liquid that can be painted on a wall by a brush. They claim that applications of the moss mixture or water may be needed to create a fuller effect. However photos or time-lapse videos of the results are never shown. Many people have tried to replicate the process but it didn't work.

Placed throughout Boston, Massachusetts, and the surrounding cities of Cambridge and Somerville by Peter ""Zebbler"" Berdovsky and Sean Stevens, these devices were part of a nationwide guerrilla marketing advertising campaign for <i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters</i>. </p><p>The massive panic led to controversy and criticism from U.S. media sources, including <i>The Boston Globe</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Fox News, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, CNN, and <i>The Boston Herald</i>. Some ridiculed the city's response to the devices – including the arrests of the two men hired to place the placards around the area – as disproportionate and indicative of a generation gap between city officials and the younger residents of Boston, at whom the ads were targeted. Several sources noted that the hundreds of officers in the Boston police department or city emergency planning office on scene were unable to identify the figure depicted for several hours until a young staffer at Mayor Thomas Menino's office saw the media coverage and recognized the figures. </p><p>After the devices were removed, the Boston Police Department stated in its defense that the ad devices shared some similarities with improvised explosive devices, with them also discovering an identifiable power source, a circuit board with exposed wiring, and electrical tape. Investigators were not mollified by the discovery that the devices were not explosive in nature, stating they still intended to determine ""if this event was a hoax or something else entirely"". Although city prosecutors eventually concluded there was no ill intent involved in the placing of the ads, the city continues to refer to the event as a ""bomb hoax"" (implying intent) rather than a ""bomb scare"".</p><p>Reflecting years later, various academics and media sources have characterized the phenomenon as a form of social panic. Gregory Bergman wrote in his 2008 book <i>BizzWords</i> that the devices were basically a self-made form of the children's toy Lite-Brite. Bruce Schneier wrote in his 2009 book <i>Schneier on Security</i> that Boston officials were ""ridiculed"" for their overreaction to the incident. In his 2009 book <i>Secret Agents</i>, historian and communication professor Jeremy Packer discussed a cultural phenomenon called the ""panic discourse"" and described the incident as a ""spectacular instance of this panic"". In a 2012 article, <i>The Boston Phoenix</i> called the incident the ""Great Mooninite Panic of 2007"".

The first flour and saw mills in Altona were built by Abraham Reesor, son of Peter Reesor and a nephew to Abraham Stouffer, in 1850, on Lot 30, Concession 9, a short distance south of the Uxbridge-Pickering Townline. In the same year, Joseph Monkhouse built a general store and William Cooper an inn.</p> <p>In 1852, the Altona Mennonite Meeting House (5475 Sideline 30, Pickering) was erected, constructed by area Mennonite settlers. The bricks were made at the Cherrywood brick yard. Local families included the Barkeys, Reesors, Widemans, Nighswanders, Hoovers and Stouffers. The first grave is dated 1835. The founder of Stouffville, Abraham Stouffer and his wife Elizabeth Reesor Stouffer, are buried here.</p><p>The first schoolhouse was built in 1834; in 1856 there were 256 inhabitants, ""unable to read and write, about 30%."" By 1869 the hamlet had 200 residents and a regular stage coach to Stouffville and Toronto.

Under the current plan, the approach for one of the three landing strips for the Pickering Airport would be directly over the former hamlet of Altona, with planes descending at an elevation of approximately 300 metres. The plan anticipates 11.9 million passengers per year (or 32,600 per day) by 2032.

In ""Trapped in the Sky"", master criminal the Hood plants a bomb on board the new atomic-powered airliner <i>Fireflash</i> before it departs on its maiden flight. Unable to land for fear of setting off the bomb, the crew and passengers' only hope of survival lies with International Rescue. </p><p>While planning the episode, the Andersons drew inspiration from Gerry's memories of his National Service in the RAF, during which he witnessed the fatal crash of a Mosquito aircraft and the emergency landing of a damaged Spitfire.

Airport apron	<p>The <b>airport apron</b>, <b>apron</b>, <b>flight line</b>, <b>ramp</b>, or <b>tarmac</b> is the area of an airport where aircraft are parked, unloaded or loaded, refueled, boarded, or maintained. Although the use of the apron is covered by regulations, such as lighting on vehicles, it is typically more accessible to users than the runway or taxiway. However, the apron is not usually open to the general public and a permit may be required to gain access. An apron's designated areas for aircraft parking are called <i>aircraft stands</i>.</p><p>By extension, the term <i>apron</i> is also used to identify the air traffic control position responsible for coordinating movement on this surface at busier airports. When the aerodrome control tower does not have control over the apron, the use of the apron may be controlled by an <i>apron management service</i> (<i>apron control</i> or <i>apron advisory</i>) to provide coordination between the users. Apron control allocates aircraft parking stands (gates) and communicates this information to tower or ground control and to airline handling agents; it also authorises vehicle movements where they could conflict with taxiing aircraft such as outside of painted road markings. The authority responsible for the aprons is also responsible for relaying to ATC information about the apron conditions such as water, snow, construction or maintenance works on or adjacent to the apron, temporary hazards such as birds or parked vehicles, systems failure etc. Procedures should be established for a coordinated information provision between the aircraft, vehicle, apron control unit and ATC to facilitate the orderly transition of aircraft between the apron management unit and the aerodrome control tower.</p><p>The apron is designated by the ICAO as not being part of the maneuvering area but included in the movement area. <i>Aircraft stand taxilanes</i> (providing access to aircraft stands) and <i>apron taxiways</i> (taxi routes across the apron) are located on the apron.

Airport check-in	"<p><b>Airport check-in</b> is the process whereby an airline approves airplane passengers to board an airplane for a flight. Airlines typically use service counters found at airports for this process, and the check-in is normally handled by an airline itself or a handling agent working on behalf of an airline. Passengers usually hand over any baggage that they do not wish or are not allowed to carry in the aircraft's cabin and receive a boarding pass before they can proceed to board their aircraft. </p><p>Check-in is usually the first procedure for a passenger when arriving at an airport, as airline regulations require passengers to check in by certain times prior to the departure of a flight. This duration spans from 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the destination and airline (with self check in, this can be expanded to 24 hours, if checking in by online processes). During this process, the passenger often has the ability to ask for special accommodations such as seating preferences, inquire about flight or destination information, accumulate frequent flyer program miles, or pay for upgrades. The airline check-in's main function, however, is to accept luggage that is to go in the aircraft's cargo hold and issue boarding passes.

Taxiway	<p>A <b>taxiway</b> is a path for aircraft at an airport connecting runways with aprons, hangars, terminals and other facilities. They mostly have a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete, although smaller general aviation airports sometimes use gravel or grass. </p><p>Most airports do not have a specific speed limit for taxiing (though some do). There is a general rule on safe speed based on obstacles. Operators and aircraft manufacturers might have limits. Typical taxi speeds are 20–30 knots (37–56 km/h; 23–35 mph).</p>	a taxiway is a path for aircraft at an airport connecting runways with aprons hangars terminals and other facilities they mostly have a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete although smaller general aviation airports sometimes use gravel or grass most airports do not have a specific speed limit for taxiing though some do there is a general rule on safe speed based on obstacles operators and aircraft manufacturers might have limits typical taxi speeds are 20–30 knots 37–56 kmh 23–35 mph	path for aircraft at an aerodrome connecting runways with aprons, hangars, terminals and other facilities	path for aircraft at an aerodrome connecting runways with aprons hangars terminals and other facilities	Airports
Automatic terminal information service	<p><b>Automatic terminal information service</b>, or <b>ATIS</b>, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas, i.e. airports and their immediate surroundings. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important NOTAMs. Pilots usually listen to an available ATIS broadcast before contacting the local control unit, which reduces the controllers' workload and relieves frequency congestion.</p><p>In the US, ATIS will include (in this order): the airport or facility name; a phonetic letter code; time of the latest weather observation in UTC time; weather information consisting of wind direction and velocity, visibility, obstructions to vision, sky condition, temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, density altitude advisory if appropriate; and other pertinent remarks, including runway in use. If it exists, the weather observation includes remarks of lightning, cumulonimbus, and towering cumulus clouds. Additionally, ATIS may contain Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) alert and advisory, reported unauthorized laser illumination events, instrument or visual approaches in use, departure runways, taxiway closures, new or temporary changes to runway length, runway condition and codes, other optional information, and advisories. </p><p>The recording is updated in fixed intervals or when there is a significant change in the information, e.g. a change in the active runway. It is given a letter designation (e.g. <i>bravo</i>) from the ICAO spelling alphabet. The letter progresses through the alphabet with every update and starts at <i>alpha</i> after a break in service of 12 hours or more. When contacting the local control unit, pilots indicate their <i>information &lt;letter&gt;</i>, where &lt;letter&gt; is the ATIS identification letter of the ATIS transmission the pilot received. This helps the ATC controller verify that the pilot has all current information.</p><p>Many airports also employ the use of Data-link ATIS (D-ATIS). D-ATIS is a text-based, digitally transmitted version of the ATIS audio broadcast. It is accessed via a data link service such as the ACARS and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft. D-ATIS is incorporated on the aircraft as part of its electronic system, such as an EFB or an FMS. D-ATIS may be incorporated into the core ATIS system, or be realized as a separate system with a data interface between voice ATIS and D-ATIS. </p>	automatic terminal information service or atis is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas ie airports and their immediate surroundings atis broadcasts contain essential information such as current weather information active runways available approaches and any other information required by the pilots such as important notams pilots usually listen to an available atis broadcast before contacting the local control unit which reduces the controllers workload and relieves frequency congestionin the us atis will include in this order the airport or facility name a phonetic letter code time of the latest weather observation in utc time weather information consisting of wind direction and velocity visibility obstructions to vision sky condition temperature dew point altimeter setting density altitude advisory if appropriate and other pertinent remarks including runway in use if it exists the weather observation includes remarks of lightning cumulonimbus and towering cumulus clouds additionally atis may contain manportable air defense systems manpads alert and advisory reported unauthorized laser illumination events instrument or visual approaches in use departure runways taxiway closures new or temporary changes to runway length runway condition and codes other optional information and advisories the recording is updated in fixed intervals or when there is a significant change in the information eg a change in the active runway it is given a letter designation eg bravo from the icao spelling alphabet the letter progresses through the alphabet with every update and starts at alpha after a break in service of 12 hours or more when contacting the local control unit pilots indicate their information ltlettergt where ltlettergt is the atis identification letter of the atis transmission the pilot received this helps the atc controller verify that the pilot has all current informationmany airports also employ the use of datalink atis datis datis is a textbased digitally transmitted version of the atis audio broadcast it is accessed via a data link service such as the acars and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft datis is incorporated on the aircraft as part of its electronic system such as an efb or an fms datis may be incorporated into the core atis system or be realized as a separate system with a data interface between voice atis and datis	continuous broadcast of aeronautical information near airports	continuous broadcast of aeronautical information near airports	Airports
Aviation light signals	"<p>In the case of a radio failure or aircraft not equipped with a radio, or in the case of a deaf pilot, air traffic control may use a signal lamp (called a ""signal light gun"" or ""light gun"" by the FAA) to direct the aircraft. ICAO regulations require air traffic control towers to possess such signal lamps. The signal lamp has a focused bright beam and is capable of emitting three different colours: red, white and green. These colors may be flashed or steady, and have different meanings to aircraft in flight or on the ground. Planes can acknowledge the instruction by rocking their wings, moving the ailerons if on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during hours of darkness. Air Traffic Control signal light guns are typically specified with a (white) center beam brightness of &gt; 180,000 - 200,000 candela, and are visible for roughly 4 miles in clear daylight conditions. The table below describes the meaning of the signals. The use of handheld combination red/green/white signal lamps for air traffic control dates back to at least the 1930s.</p>"	in the case of a radio failure or aircraft not equipped with a radio or in the case of a deaf pilot air traffic control may use a signal lamp called a signal light gun or light gun by the faa to direct the aircraft icao regulations require air traffic control towers to possess such signal lamps the signal lamp has a focused bright beam and is capable of emitting three different colours red white and green these colors may be flashed or steady and have different meanings to aircraft in flight or on the ground planes can acknowledge the instruction by rocking their wings moving the ailerons if on the ground or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during hours of darkness air traffic control signal light guns are typically specified with a white center beam brightness of gt 180000 200000 candela and are visible for roughly 4 miles in clear daylight conditions the table below describes the meaning of the signals the use of handheld combination redgreenwhite signal lamps for air traffic control dates back to at least the 1930s	use of visible electromagnetic radiation to conduct air traffic control	use of visible electromagnetic radiation to conduct air traffic control	Airports
Airport surveillance radar	<p>An <b>airport surveillance radar (ASR)</b> is a radar system used at airports to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the <i>terminal area</i>, the airspace around airports. It is the main air traffic control system for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport below an elevation of 25,000 feet. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems, the <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> surveillance radar. The primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface. The secondary surveillance radar consists of a second rotating antenna, often mounted on the primary antenna, which interrogates the transponders of aircraft, which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft's identification, barometric altitude, and an emergency status code, which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radar.</p><p>The positions of the aircraft are displayed on a screen; at large airports on multiple screens in an operations room at the airport called in the US the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), monitored by air traffic controllers who direct the traffic by communicating with the aircraft pilots by radio. They are responsible for maintaining a safe and orderly flow of traffic and adequate aircraft separation to prevent midair collisions. </p>	an airport surveillance radar asr is a radar system used at airports to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area the airspace around airports it is the main air traffic control system for the airspace around airports at large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles 96 km of the airport below an elevation of 25000 feet the sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems the primary and secondary surveillance radar the primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fanshaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport it detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircrafts surface the secondary surveillance radar consists of a second rotating antenna often mounted on the primary antenna which interrogates the transponders of aircraft which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircrafts identification barometric altitude and an emergency status code which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radarthe positions of the aircraft are displayed on a screen at large airports on multiple screens in an operations room at the airport called in the us the terminal radar approach control tracon monitored by air traffic controllers who direct the traffic by communicating with the aircraft pilots by radio they are responsible for maintaining a safe and orderly flow of traffic and adequate aircraft separation to prevent midair collisions	radar system	radar system	Airports
Engineered materials arrestor system	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>engineered materials arrestor system</b>, <b>engineered materials arresting system</b> (<b>EMAS</b>), or <b>arrester bed</b> is a bed of engineered materials built at the end of a runway to reduce the severity of the consequences of a runway excursion. Engineered materials are defined in FAA Advisory Circular No 150/5220-22B as ""high energy absorbing materials of selected strength, which will reliably and predictably crush under the weight of an aircraft"". While the current technology involves lightweight, crushable concrete blocks, any material that has been approved to meet the FAA Advisory Circular can be used for an EMAS. The purpose of an EMAS is to stop an aircraft overrun with no human injury and minimal aircraft damage. The aircraft is slowed by the loss of energy required to crush the EMAS material. An EMAS is similar in concept to the runaway truck ramp or race circuit gravel trap, made of gravel or sand. It is intended to stop an aircraft that has overshot a runway when there is an insufficient free space for a standard runway safety area (RSA). Multiple patents have been issued on the construction and design on the materials and process. </p><p>FAA Advisory Circular 150/5220-22B explains that an EMAS may not be effective for incidents involving aircraft of less than 11,000 kilograms (25,000 lb) weight. It also clarifies that an EMAS is not the same as a stopway, which is defined in FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13A, Section 312.</p><p>As of May 2017, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been working on developing a harmonized regulation regarding arresting systems. </p><p>Research projects completed in Europe have looked into the cost-effectiveness of EMAS. Arrestor beds have been installed at airports where the runway safety areas are below standards, and their ability to stop aircraft with minimal or no damage to the air frame and its occupants has proven to bring results far beyond the cost of installations. The latest report, ""Estimated Cost-Benefit Analysis of Runway Severity Reduction Based on Actual Arrestments"", shows how the money saved through the first 11 arrestments has reached a calculated total of 1.9 billion USD, thus saving more than $1 B over the estimated cost of development (R&amp;D, all installations worldwide, maintenance and repairs reaching a total of USD 600 million). The study suggests that mitigating the consequences of runway excursions worldwide may turn out to be much more cost-effective than the current focus on reducing the already very low probability of occurrence.</p>"	an engineered materials arrestor system engineered materials arresting system emas or arrester bed is a bed of engineered materials built at the end of a runway to reduce the severity of the consequences of a runway excursion engineered materials are defined in faa advisory circular no 150522022b as high energy absorbing materials of selected strength which will reliably and predictably crush under the weight of an aircraft while the current technology involves lightweight crushable concrete blocks any material that has been approved to meet the faa advisory circular can be used for an emas the purpose of an emas is to stop an aircraft overrun with no human injury and minimal aircraft damage the aircraft is slowed by the loss of energy required to crush the emas material an emas is similar in concept to the runaway truck ramp or race circuit gravel trap made of gravel or sand it is intended to stop an aircraft that has overshot a runway when there is an insufficient free space for a standard runway safety area rsa multiple patents have been issued on the construction and design on the materials and process faa advisory circular 150522022b explains that an emas may not be effective for incidents involving aircraft of less than 11000 kilograms 25000 lb weight it also clarifies that an emas is not the same as a stopway which is defined in faa advisory circular 150530013a section 312as of may 2017 the international civil aviation organization icao has been working on developing a harmonized regulation regarding arresting systems research projects completed in europe have looked into the costeffectiveness of emas arrestor beds have been installed at airports where the runway safety areas are below standards and their ability to stop aircraft with minimal or no damage to the air frame and its occupants has proven to bring results far beyond the cost of installations the latest report estimated costbenefit analysis of runway severity reduction based on actual arrestments shows how the money saved through the first 11 arrestments has reached a calculated total of 19 billion usd thus saving more than 1 b over the estimated cost of development rampd all installations worldwide maintenance and repairs reaching a total of usd 600 million the study suggests that mitigating the consequences of runway excursions worldwide may turn out to be much more costeffective than the current focus on reducing the already very low probability of occurrence	bed of engineered materials built at the end of a runway	bed of engineered materials built at the end of a runway	Airports

Cross Border Xpress	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1066479718""><p><b>Cross Border Xpress</b> (<b>CBX</b>), historically also called the <b>Tijuana Cross-border Terminal</b> and the <b>Puerta de las Californias</b>, is an airport terminal located in the Otay Mesa area of southern San Diego, California, United States, with an access bridge connecting it to the Tijuana International Airport in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. It opened on December 9, 2015. It makes Tijuana Airport a geographically binational airport. Unlike the binational airports serving the Swiss cities of Basel (entirely on French territory) and Geneva (entirely on Swiss territory), the CBX terminal is physically located in the United States but serves an airport whose main terminal and runways are in Mexico. A pedestrian bridge spans the United States–Mexico border, connecting passenger terminals between the two countries.

Airport	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>airport</b> is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation. </p><p>Operating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters. </p>"	an airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities mostly for commercial air transport airports usually consists of a landing area which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers hangars and terminals to maintain and monitor aircraft larger airports may have airport aprons taxiway bridges air traffic control centres passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges and emergency services in some countries the us in particular airports also typically have one or more fixedbase operators serving general aviation operating airports is extremely complicated with a complex system of aircraft support services passenger services and aircraft control services contained within the operation thus airports can be major employers as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports in order to reduce hazards additionally airports have major local environmental impacts as both large sources of air pollution noise pollution and other environmental impacts making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters	location where aircraft take off and land with extended support facilities, mostly for commercial air transport	location where aircraft take off and land with extended support facilities mostly for commercial air transport	Airports
Airport malaria	<p><b>Airport malaria</b>, sometimes known as <b>baggage</b>, <b>luggage</b> or <b>suitcase</b> <b>malaria</b>, occurs when a malaria infected female <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito travels by aircraft from a country where malaria is common, arrives in a country where malaria is usually not found, and bites a person at or around the vicinity of the airport, or if the climate is suitable, travels in luggage and bites a person further away. The infected person usually presents with a fever in the absence of a recent travel history. There is often no suspicion of malaria, resulting in a delay in diagnosis and often death. Other causes of imported malaria need to be excluded first.</p><p>Most mosquitoes on aircraft do not carry malaria and the few that do are relatively inefficient invaders. The climate of the host country also offers natural protection. The detection and treatment is the same as of malaria in general. Prevention involves control of mosquitoes at and around airports in the countries of departure and on the aircraft.</p><p>Studies of airport malaria have been largely observations of individual scenarios, all unique in timing, place of infection and problems, in addition to possibilities of error.</p>	airport malaria sometimes known as baggage luggage or suitcase malaria occurs when a malaria infected female anopheles mosquito travels by aircraft from a country where malaria is common arrives in a country where malaria is usually not found and bites a person at or around the vicinity of the airport or if the climate is suitable travels in luggage and bites a person further away the infected person usually presents with a fever in the absence of a recent travel history there is often no suspicion of malaria resulting in a delay in diagnosis and often death other causes of imported malaria need to be excluded firstmost mosquitoes on aircraft do not carry malaria and the few that do are relatively inefficient invaders the climate of the host country also offers natural protection the detection and treatment is the same as of malaria in general prevention involves control of mosquitoes at and around airports in the countries of departure and on the aircraftstudies of airport malaria have been largely observations of individual scenarios all unique in timing place of infection and problems in addition to possibilities of error	occurs when a malaria infected female Anopheles mosquito travels by aircraft from a country where malaria is common	occurs when a malaria infected female anopheles mosquito travels by aircraft from a country where malaria is common	Airports

Unlike other metro lines, the M11 will be a limited stop service, meaning that stations will be spaced further apart. This is most noticeable towards the line's southern ends, where the M11 will only have seven stations within Istanbul's urban area: Halkalı, Tema Park, Olimpiyat, Kayaşehir and Fenertepe in the west and Gayrettepe and Kağıthane in the east. </p><p>It will have two legs, one from Gayrettepe to Istanbul Airport line and the second from Halkalı to Istanbul Airport line.

The second leg of the line will be 31.5 km (19.6 mi) long with seven stations, in a total of 69 km (43 mi) with sixteen stations. The travel time between the end stations will be 60 minutes at a maximum speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). The line will run through five districts of Istanbul, Şişli, Eyüp, Arnavutköy, Başakşehir and Küçükçekmece. It is expected that the line will carry annually around 94 million passengers.

The successful tenderer would receive a monopoly on traffic between the airport and Stockholm until 2040. The line and the services were inaugurated on 25 November 1999. The PPP contract has since been criticized for being unclear, uneconomical for the state and leading to a low utilization of the service as ticket prices are very expensive at 300 SEK (around 30 EUR) for an adult single ticket on the very short journey.

List of shortest runways	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>This is a <b>list of the shortest airport runways</b> in the world. While most modern commercial aircraft require a paved runway of at least 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in length, many early aircraft were designed to operate from unprepared strips that could be improvised in small spaces. Los Angeles's Grand Central Airport, considered a landmark in aviation history, had a 1,200-foot (370 m) runway during its first six years of operation from 1923 to 1929. Such airstrips were used by heavy as well as light aircraft. During the Doolittle Raid in WW II, twin-engine B-25 bombers with a loaded weight of seventeen tons took off from the 827-foot (252 m) flight deck of the carrier USS <i>Hornet</i>. As late as 1977 a Lockheed Constellation demonstrated its ability to use the 2,700-foot (820 m) runway of the Greenwood Lake Airport in New Jersey, and in 1946, a lightened Constellation took off from a grass strip in 2,000 feet (600 m) on only three engines. Most general aviation aircraft retain this short-field performance; the Cessna 172, the most produced aircraft in history, will take off in as little as 720 feet (220 m) when fully loaded. Many small airfields capable of accommodating these types remain in use, mostly in remote areas in the American West and the French Alps, where space is limited. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1444 Cached time: 20220514094756 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [] CPU time usage: 0.156 seconds Real time usage: 0.205 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 361/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 4282/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 444/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 415/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.062/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 2957829/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 178.899 1 -total 50.43% 90.218 1 Template:Short_description 25.05% 44.812 1 Template:Pagetype 23.52% 42.083 1 Template:Expand_list 21.83% 39.057 6 Template:Convert 21.45% 38.380 3 Template:Main_other 10.35% 18.510 1 Template:SDcat 9.20% 16.460 1 Template:Ambox 8.75% 15.651 1 Template:TDMCA 7.49% 13.397 1 Template:DMCA -->"	this is a list of the shortest airport runways in the world while most modern commercial aircraft require a paved runway of at least 6000 feet 1800 m in length many early aircraft were designed to operate from unprepared strips that could be improvised in small spaces los angeless grand central airport considered a landmark in aviation history had a 1200foot 370 m runway during its first six years of operation from 1923 to 1929 such airstrips were used by heavy as well as light aircraft during the doolittle raid in ww ii twinengine b25 bombers with a loaded weight of seventeen tons took off from the 827foot 252 m flight deck of the carrier uss hornet as late as 1977 a lockheed constellation demonstrated its ability to use the 2700foot 820 m runway of the greenwood lake airport in new jersey and in 1946 a lightened constellation took off from a grass strip in 2000 feet 600 m on only three engines most general aviation aircraft retain this shortfield performance the cessna 172 the most produced aircraft in history will take off in as little as 720 feet 220 m when fully loaded many small airfields capable of accommodating these types remain in use mostly in remote areas in the american west and the french alps where space is limited	List	list	Airports

Relief airport	<p>A <b>relief airport</b> or <b>reliever airport</b> is an airport that is built or designated to provide relief or additional capacity to an area when the primary commercial airport(s) requires additional capacity, on a long-term or temporary basis. Reliever airports may also relieve the need for capacity by relocating non-jet general aviation activity from a commercial airport to a different facility. By removing aircraft with lower capacities and slower speeds, the commercial service airport is able to operate more flights with larger aircraft and handle more passengers increasing the efficiency with minimal additional cost in facilities. This also spreads out the aircraft over a wider area generally improving air traffic in the entire community. </p><p>In the USA, for an airport to qualify as a FAA-designated reliever, it must have 100 or more based aircraft or 25,000 annual itinerant operations.</p>	a relief airport or reliever airport is an airport that is built or designated to provide relief or additional capacity to an area when the primary commercial airports requires additional capacity on a longterm or temporary basis reliever airports may also relieve the need for capacity by relocating nonjet general aviation activity from a commercial airport to a different facility by removing aircraft with lower capacities and slower speeds the commercial service airport is able to operate more flights with larger aircraft and handle more passengers increasing the efficiency with minimal additional cost in facilities this also spreads out the aircraft over a wider area generally improving air traffic in the entire community in the usa for an airport to qualify as a faadesignated reliever it must have 100 or more based aircraft or 25000 annual itinerant operations	airport made to add additional capacity	airport made to add additional capacity	Airports

He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as <i>trencadís</i> which used waste ceramic pieces. </p><p>Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí became part of the <i>Modernista</i> movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream <i>Modernisme</i>, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and moulding the details as he conceived them. </p><p>Gaudí's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects. His masterpiece, the still-incomplete Sagrada Família, is the most-visited monument in Spain. Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Gaudí's Roman Catholic faith intensified during his life and religious images appear in many of his works. This earned him the nickname ""God's Architect"" and led to calls for his beatification.</p>"	antoni gaudí i cornet catalan ənˈtɔni ɣəwˈði 25 june 1852 – 10 june 1926 was a catalan architect from spain known as the greatest exponent of catalan modernism gaudís works have a highly individualized sui generis style most are located in barcelona including his main work the church of the sagrada família gaudís work was influenced by his passions in life architecture nature and religion he considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics stained glass wrought ironwork forging and carpentry he also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces under the influence of neogothic art and oriental techniques gaudí became part of the modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries his work transcended mainstream modernisme culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works instead preferring to create them as threedimensional scale models and moulding the details as he conceived them gaudís work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects his masterpiece the stillincomplete sagrada família is the mostvisited monument in spain between 1984 and 2005 seven of his works were declared world heritage sites by unesco gaudís roman catholic faith intensified during his life and religious images appear in many of his works this earned him the nickname gods architect and led to calls for his beatification	Spanish architect	spanish architect	Artists

[...] In an attempt to understand the importance of Jean Metzinger in Modern Art, we could limit ourselves to three considerations. Firstly, there is the often overlooked importance of Metzinger's Divisionist Period of 1900–1908. Secondly, there is the role of Metzinger in the founding of the Cubist School. Thirdly, there is the consideration of Metzinger's whole Cubist Period from 1909 to 1930.

Hedgebrook	"<p><b>Hedgebrook</b> is a rural retreat for women writers on Whidbey Island, Washington, founded in 1988. Hedgebrook's artist-in-residence program accepts up to 80 writers each year, who spend two to four weeks in residence working on their diverse writing projects. Each writer stays in her own hand-crafted cottage. Room and board are provided at no cost to the writers-in-residence. The retreat is a working farm, offering organic produce for the writers, and communal dinners each night prepared by in-house chefs.</p><p>Hedgebrook's global community of alumnae, more than 2,000 writers from all over the world, include celebrated author Gloria Steinem, poets Naomi Shihab Nye, Suheir Hammad, playwrights Dael Orlandersmith, Ellen McLaughlin, and Eve Ensler, novelists Nassim Assefi, Bernardine Evaristo, Sarah Ladipo Manyika, Mary Gordon, Ruth Ozeki, Elizabeth George, and Sarah Waters, memoirists Honor Moore and Carolyn Forché, non-fiction writers Pramila Jayapal and Holly Morris, and solo performer Sarah Jones. </p><p>Hedgebrook's Radical Craft Classes offer women writers the unique opportunity to study with renowned women writers such as Jane Hamilton, Theresa Rebeck, Karen Joy Fowler, Victoria Redel, Claire Dederer and Robin Swicord. The week-long writing workshops, offered in a variety of genres (fiction, memoir, playwriting, screenwriting, poetry), focus on different aspects of the writer's craft and process. </p><p>The annual Hedgebrook Women Playwrights Festival (HWPF) celebrates the work of women writing for the theatre. Since the festival’s inauguration in 1998, HWPF has supported the work of an impressive array of women playwrights and served an important role in the development of new plays by women. The festival begins with a ""pre-retreat"" weekend, in which the playwrights have the opportunity to get to know one another, hear each other’s plays read aloud, and share responses with an intimate group of theatre professionals in a relaxed, convivial atmosphere. This is followed by a two-week retreat at Hedgebrook, where each playwright has her own private cottage, a dramaturg on-call, and the opportunity to work in Hedgebrook’s unique combination of solitude and community. The retreat is capped off with public presentations of excerpts from each play. </p><p>Participation in the Hedgebrook Women Playwrights Festival is by invitation in collaboration with partner theatres from around the country. In recognition of the fact that fewer than 20% of the plays produced each year on US stages are by women, Hedgebrook is partnering with theatres who show their commitment to women playwrights through commissions, development and production opportunities. In this way, Hedgebrook forges opportunities for women playwrights to deepen their relationships with theatres and is becoming a major pipeline for plays by women to move from creation to development and production. Current partners include: Denver Theatre Center, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Seattle's ACT Theatre, Chicago's Goodman Theatre and Center Theatre Group, Los Angeles. </p><p>HWPF plays have gone on to productions around the country.

Newlyn School	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Newlyn School</b> was an art colony of artists based in or near Newlyn, a fishing village adjacent to Penzance, on the south coast of Cornwall, from the 1880s until the early twentieth century. The establishment of the Newlyn School was reminiscent of the Barbizon School in France, where artists fled Paris to paint in a more pure setting emphasising natural light. These schools along with a related California movement were also known as En plein air. </p><p>Some of the first British artists to settle in the area had already travelled in Brittany, but found in Newlyn a comparable English environment with a number of things guaranteed to attract them: fantastic light, cheap living, and the availability of inexpensive models. The artists were fascinated by the fishermen's working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages. Some paintings showed the hazards and tragedy of the community's life, such as women anxiously looking out to sea as the boats go out, or a young woman crying on hearing news of a disaster. Walter Langley is generally recognised as the pioneer of the Newlyn art colony and Stanhope Forbes, who settled there in 1884, as the father of it. The later Forbes School of Painting, founded by Forbes and his wife Elizabeth in 1899, promoted the study of figure painting. A present-day Newlyn School of Art was formed in 2011 with Arts Council funding providing art courses taught by many of the best-known artists working in Cornwall today. </p><p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Lamorna, a nearby fishing village to the south, became popular with artists of the Newlyn School and is particularly associated with the artist S.

Jerome, Arizona	"<p><b>Jerome</b> is a town in the Black Hills of Yavapai County in the U.S. state of Arizona. Founded in the late 19th century on Cleopatra Hill overlooking the Verde Valley, Jerome is located more than 5,000 feet (1,500 m) above sea level. It is about 100 miles (160 km) north of Phoenix along State Route 89A between Sedona and Prescott. Supported in its heyday by rich copper mines, it was home to more than 10,000 people in the 1920s. As of the 2010 census, its population was 444. It is now known for its tourist attractions, such as its ""ghost town"" status and local wineries.</p><p>The town owes its existence mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 1.75<span> </span>billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano. Tectonic plate movements, plate collisions, uplift, deposition, erosion, and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface, both near Jerome. In the late 19th century, the United Verde Mine, developed by William A. Clark, extracted ore bearing copper, gold, silver, and other metals from the larger of the two. The United Verde Extension UVX Mine, owned by James Douglas Jr., depended on the other huge deposit. In total, the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of Jerome were among the richest ever found. </p><p>Jerome made news in 1917 when labor unrest involving the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again during and after the Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed for good in 1953, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21st century, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history. </p>"	jerome is a town in the black hills of yavapai county in the us state of arizona founded in the late 19th century on cleopatra hill overlooking the verde valley jerome is located more than 5000 feet 1500 m above sea level it is about 100 miles 160 km north of phoenix along state route 89a between sedona and prescott supported in its heyday by rich copper mines it was home to more than 10000 people in the 1920s as of the 2010 census its population was 444 it is now known for its tourist attractions such as its ghost town status and local wineriesthe town owes its existence mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 175 billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano tectonic plate movements plate collisions uplift deposition erosion and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface both near jerome in the late 19th century the united verde mine developed by william a clark extracted ore bearing copper gold silver and other metals from the larger of the two the united verde extension uvx mine owned by james douglas jr depended on the other huge deposit in total the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of jerome were among the richest ever found jerome made news in 1917 when labor unrest involving the industrial workers of the world iww led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 iww members who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west production at the mines always subject to fluctuations boomed during world war i fell thereafter rose again then fell again during and after the great depression as the ore deposits ran out the mines closed for good in 1953 and the population dwindled to fewer than 100 efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales jerome became a national historic landmark in 1967 by the early 21st century jerome had art galleries coffee houses restaurants a state park and a local museum devoted to mining history	town in Arizona, United States	town in arizona united states	Artists

Art colony	<p>An <b>art colony,</b> also known as an <b>artists' colony,</b> can be defined two ways. Its most liberal description refers to the organic congregation of artists in towns, villages and rural areas, often drawn by areas of natural beauty, the prior existence of other artists or art schools there, and a lower cost of living. More commonly, the term refers to the guest-host model of a mission-driven planned community, which administers a formal process for awarding artist residencies. In the latter case, a typical mission might include providing artists with the time, space and support to create; fostering community among artists; and providing arts education (lectures, workshops) to the public. Early 20th century American guest-host models include New Hampshire's MacDowell Colony and New York's Yaddo. </p><p>World-wide, the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are Res Artis, in Amsterdam, and the Alliance of Artists Communities, in Providence, Rhode Island.

Barbizon school	"<p>The <b>Barbizon school</b> of painters were part of an art movement towards Realism in art, which arose in the context of the dominant Romantic Movement of the time. The Barbizon school was active roughly from 1830 through 1870. It takes its name from the village of Barbizon, France, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where many of the artists gathered. Most of their works were landscape painting, but several of them also painted landscapes with farmworkers, and genre scenes of village life. Some of the most prominent features of this school are its tonal qualities, color, loose brushwork, and softness of form.</p><p>The leaders of the Barbizon school were: Théodore Rousseau, Charles-François Daubigny, Jules Dupré, Constant Troyon, Charles Jacque, and Narcisse Virgilio Díaz. Jean-François Millet lived in Barbizon from 1849, but his interest in figures with a landscape backdrop sets him rather apart from the others. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was the earliest on the scene, first painting in the forest in 1829, but British art historian Harold Osborne suggested that “his work has a poetic and literary quality which sets him somewhat apart"". Other artists associated with the school, often pupils of the main group, include: Henri Harpignies, Albert Charpin, François-Louis Français, and Émile van Marcke. </p><p>Many of the artists were also printmakers, mostly in etching but the group also provided the bulk of the artists using the semiphotographic cliché verre technique. The French etching revival began with the school, in the 1850s.</p>"	the barbizon school of painters were part of an art movement towards realism in art which arose in the context of the dominant romantic movement of the time the barbizon school was active roughly from 1830 through 1870 it takes its name from the village of barbizon france on the edge of the forest of fontainebleau where many of the artists gathered most of their works were landscape painting but several of them also painted landscapes with farmworkers and genre scenes of village life some of the most prominent features of this school are its tonal qualities color loose brushwork and softness of formthe leaders of the barbizon school were théodore rousseau charlesfrançois daubigny jules dupré constant troyon charles jacque and narcisse virgilio díaz jeanfrançois millet lived in barbizon from 1849 but his interest in figures with a landscape backdrop sets him rather apart from the others jeanbaptistecamille corot was the earliest on the scene first painting in the forest in 1829 but british art historian harold osborne suggested that “ his work has a poetic and literary quality which sets him somewhat apart other artists associated with the school often pupils of the main group include henri harpignies albert charpin françoislouis français and émile van marcke many of the artists were also printmakers mostly in etching but the group also provided the bulk of the artists using the semiphotographic cliché verre technique the french etching revival began with the school in the 1850s	artistic movement of landscape painters of the first part and mid-19th century	artistic movement of landscape painters of the first part and mid19th century	Artists

Art commune	<p>An <b>art commune</b> is a communal living situation or commune where collective art is produced as a function of the group's activities. Contemporary art communes are scattered around the world, yet frequently aloof to widespread attention due to displeasure or discomfort with mainstream society. In the 1960s and 1970s art communes such as Friedrichshof (also known as Aktionsanalytische Organisation) flourished. Creative art was enthusiastically produced within such groups, which became gathering points for the counterculture movement. </p><p>From a sociological viewpoint the art producing communes of the 1970s failed to sustain themselves, owing largely to the fact that they tended to have open memberships, which eventually attracted people with social problems. These problems then spread and become too difficult for these autonomous entities to handle, although some groups, such as the former Kunsthaus Tacheles, continued to flourish. </p><p>Today's art communes are a mix of artists, drifters, collectivists, activists, dadaists, and hangers on. Such groups are more politically and ideologically diverse than their mid-20th century counterparts, which has led to many art communes becoming more mainstream commercial entities. </p>	an art commune is a communal living situation or commune where collective art is produced as a function of the groups activities contemporary art communes are scattered around the world yet frequently aloof to widespread attention due to displeasure or discomfort with mainstream society in the 1960s and 1970s art communes such as friedrichshof also known as aktionsanalytische organisation flourished creative art was enthusiastically produced within such groups which became gathering points for the counterculture movement from a sociological viewpoint the art producing communes of the 1970s failed to sustain themselves owing largely to the fact that they tended to have open memberships which eventually attracted people with social problems these problems then spread and become too difficult for these autonomous entities to handle although some groups such as the former kunsthaus tacheles continued to flourish todays art communes are a mix of artists drifters collectivists activists dadaists and hangers on such groups are more politically and ideologically diverse than their mid20th century counterparts which has led to many art communes becoming more mainstream commercial entities	communal living situation focused on art creation	communal living situation focused on art creation	Artists

Situated on a hilltop 600 ft (180 m) above the Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve, Pond Farm began around 1939-40 when a San Francisco-based couple named Gordon and Jane Herr (architect and writer, respectively) acquired a portion of property called Rancho Del Lago or the Walker Ranch. Initially 250 acres (1.0 km<sup>2</sup>), their property was later expanded to 400 acres (1.6 km<sup>2</sup>). Because one of its primary features was a large pond, the Herrs renamed this setting Pond Farm.

Fort Worth Circle	"<p>The <b>Fort Worth Circle</b> was a progressive art colony in Fort Worth, Texas. The colony was active during the 1940s and much of the 1950s and formed around younger artists, most of them native Texans under-30, who embraced themes not traditionally seen in Texas art up to that time. Through exhibitions and modest publicity these artists built statewide reputations during and after World War II as proponents of modern art. Social compatibility and shared affinities for modern art and classical music provided common ground among members of the circle and contributed to the group's cohesion. Within the circle's original membership, male and female artists were almost equally represented. </p><p>After World War II the Fort Worth Circle's influence expanded as younger artists became associated with the group and older members who no longer lived in Fort Worth retained their ties. Additionally, at the conclusion of World War II the ranks of Fort Worth's art community swelled with the return of artists who had served in the military. Some of these returning artists also became identified with the Fort Worth Circle. Membership changed over time, but the ""backbone"" of the colony consisted of Bill Bomar, Cynthia Brants, Veronica Helfensteller, Dickson Reeder, Flora Blanc Reeder, and Bror Utter.</p><p>The colony's presence was acknowledged by Dallas newspaper critic John Rosenfield in 1948 when he observed that a ""school"" of modern artists was at work in neighboring Fort Worth. Based on Rosenfield's characterization, the colony was long referred to by local residents as the Fort Worth School. Over time, ""Fort Worth Circle"" has replaced ""Fort Worth School"" as a more accurate summation of the colony's true nature. </p>"	the fort worth circle was a progressive art colony in fort worth texas the colony was active during the 1940s and much of the 1950s and formed around younger artists most of them native texans under30 who embraced themes not traditionally seen in texas art up to that time through exhibitions and modest publicity these artists built statewide reputations during and after world war ii as proponents of modern art social compatibility and shared affinities for modern art and classical music provided common ground among members of the circle and contributed to the groups cohesion within the circles original membership male and female artists were almost equally represented after world war ii the fort worth circles influence expanded as younger artists became associated with the group and older members who no longer lived in fort worth retained their ties additionally at the conclusion of world war ii the ranks of fort worths art community swelled with the return of artists who had served in the military some of these returning artists also became identified with the fort worth circle membership changed over time but the backbone of the colony consisted of bill bomar cynthia brants veronica helfensteller dickson reeder flora blanc reeder and bror utterthe colonys presence was acknowledged by dallas newspaper critic john rosenfield in 1948 when he observed that a school of modern artists was at work in neighboring fort worth based on rosenfields characterization the colony was long referred to by local residents as the fort worth school over time fort worth circle has replaced fort worth school as a more accurate summation of the colonys true nature	Progressive art colony in Fort Worth, Texas	progressive art colony in fort worth texas	Artists
Edendale, Los Angeles	"<p><b>Edendale</b> is a historical name for a district in Los Angeles, California, northwest of Downtown Los Angeles, in what is known today as Echo Park, Los Feliz and Silver Lake. In the opening decades of the 20th century, in the era of silent movies, Edendale was known as the home of most major movie studios on the West Coast. Among its many claims, it was home to the Keystone Kops, and the site of many movie firsts, including Charlie Chaplin's first movie, the first feature-length comedy, and the first pie-in-the-face. The Edendale movie studios were mostly concentrated in a four-block stretch of Allesandro Street, between Berkeley Avenue and Duane Street. Allesandro Street was later renamed Glendale Boulevard (and a smaller nearby street took on the name Allesandro). </p><p>Edendale's hilly streets and nearby lake lent themselves to many silent movie gags. The district's heyday as the center of the motion picture industry was in the 1910s. By the 1920s, the studios had moved elsewhere, mostly to Hollywood, which would come to supplant it as the ""movie capital of the world"".</p><p>In the years prior to World War II, Edendale had a large artist community and a large communist community. Many of its residents were transplants from the Eastern United States or the Soviet Union.</p><p>Edendale was known as such at least until 1940, as the Pacific Electric Railway operated an Edendale Line of its ""red cars"" that ran the 5-mile (8.0 km) course between Downtown Los Angeles and the top of Edendale. The red car ran down the median of Allesandro Avenue (Glendale Blvd.), which was double-tracked, and even triple-tracked between Sunset and Effie, as the tracks were also used by the interurban Glendale-Burbank Line. After 1940, the Edendale Line as such ceased, though service continued in the form of local service on the Glendale-Burbank Line. Rail service on that line ended completely in 1955, and the tracks have been abandoned. Soon after, the region was cut in two by the construction of the Glendale Freeway. </p><p>The name Edendale is no longer used as a place name, and is little known today. A few remnants of the name are the local post office (officially called Edendale Station), a public library branch, an urban farm called Edendale Farm and a restaurant called Edendale. Although many of the structures from the 1910s remain and can be identified by careful comparison with old photos, this district today is located in an unremarkable commercial zone called the ""Glendale Boulevard Corridor,"" which is known mostly for its function as a commuter thoroughfare between the southern end of the Glendale Freeway and downtown Los Angeles.

Talashkino	"<p><b>Talashkino</b> (Russian: <span lang=""ru"">Талашкино</span>) is a selo in Smolensky District, Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located 18 kilometres (11 mi) southeast of Smolensk. Talashkino is notable because in the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century it belonged to Princess Maria Tenisheva, who created here an artistic colony. The buildings of the estate are currently split between Talashkino and a nearby village, Flyonovo. </p><p>Tenisheva, sponsored by her husband, Vladimir Tenishev, bought the estate in 1893. She lived in Saint Petersburg, was educated as an artist, was acquainted with many contemporary artists, and since 1894 run a free art studio in her house, supervised by Ilya Repin, the most influential Russian painter. She was also an art collector, and in 1898 she donated all of her collection to the Russian Museum. In 1900, she opened an artisan workshop, which mainly produced ceramic and carving, and invited Sergey Malyutin to supervise it. The objective of Tenisheva was to create a ""genuine Russian style"". Apprentices, selected by Malyutin, were local peasants. Malyutin stayed in Talashkino until 1903, and in the meanwhile designed a house in Flyonovo based on Russian fairy tales. After 1903, the workshop was taken over by Alexey Zinovyev and Vladimir Beketov, who were both under influence of Nicholas Roerich. The production of the workshop was exhibited all over Russia on a regular basis; in 1902, there was a large exhibition of Talashkino products in Smolensk. Tenisheva also asked a photographer, Ivan Barshchevsky, to organize a historical museum in Talashkino, with the purpose of educating local peasants. The museum has proven to be too big and was in 1905 relocated to Smolensk. Tenisheva organized a theater and a balalaika orchestra (conducted by Vasily Lidin) in Talashkino as well. A number of Russian painters visited Tenisheva in Talashkino, including Ilya Repin, Konstantin Korovin, Mikhail Vrubel, and Nicolas Roerich.</p><p>In 1919, Tenisheva left Russia, and the estate was nationalized and decayed. Most of the buildings were lost; those which survived currently belong to the Smolensk Museum.

Banksy	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Banksy</b> is a pseudonymous England-based street artist, political activist and film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation. Active since the 1990s, his satirical street art and subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed in a distinctive stenciling technique. His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls and bridges throughout the world. Banksy's work grew out of the Bristol underground scene, which involved collaborations between artists and musicians. Banksy says that he was inspired by 3D, a graffiti artist and founding member of the musical group Massive Attack.</p><p>Banksy displays his art on publicly visible surfaces such as walls and self-built physical prop pieces.

Geminus started work in England by working with Thomas Raynalde and producing ""<i>The byrth of Mankinde</i>"" aka ""<i>The Woman's booke</i>"" in 1545. </p><p>""<i>The byrth of Mankinde</i>"", was the best English language reference work on midwifery in the 1500s. Its text was translated from Eucharius Rösslin's ""<i>Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten</i>"". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus’s ""<i>Compendiosa</i>"".</p><p>The ""<i>Compendiosa totius anatomie</i>"" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to Edward VI. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of Adam and Eve; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by Vesalius. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of ""unlatined Surgeons"". He had employed Nicholas Udall, the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of Henri de Mondeville's ""Surgery"". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). </p><p>In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. Jacques Grévin, the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569.

Hergé	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Georges Prosper Remi</b> (<small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ʁəmi]</span>; 22 May 1907 – 3 March 1983), known by the pen name <b>Hergé</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ɛʁʒe]</span>), from the French pronunciation of his reversed initials <i>RG</i>, was a Belgian cartoonist. He is best known for creating <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i>, the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, <i>Quick &amp; Flupke</i> (1930–1940) and <i>The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko</i> (1936–1957). His works were executed in his distinct <i>ligne claire</i> drawing style. </p><p>Born to a lower-middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, <i>The Adventures of Totor</i>, for <i>Le Boy-Scout Belge</i> in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper <i>Le Vingtième Siècle</i>, he created <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i> in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early installments — <i>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</i>, <i>Tintin in the Congo</i>, and <i>Tintin in America</i> — were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the <i>Quick &amp; Flupke</i> and <i>Jo, Zette and Jocko</i> series for <i>Le Vingtième Siècle</i>. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from <i>The Blue Lotus</i> onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, <i>Le Vingtième Siècle</i> was closed, but Hergé continued his series in <i>Le Soir</i>, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration. </p><p>After the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, <i>Le Soir</i> was shut down and its staff — including Hergé — accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and although no charges were brought against Hergé, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With Raymond Leblanc he established <i>Tintin</i> magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new <i>Adventures of Tintin</i> stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as Edgar P. Jacobs' <i>Blake and Mortimer</i>. In 1950 he established Studios Hergé as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members Jacques Martin and Bob de Moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i>. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced <i>Tintin in Tibet</i>, his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist. </p><p>Hergé's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a Hergé Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009. </p> "	georges prosper remi french ʁəmi 22 may 1907 – 3 march 1983 known by the pen name hergé french ɛʁʒe from the french pronunciation of his reversed initials rg was a belgian cartoonist he is best known for creating the adventures of tintin the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular european comics of the 20th century he was also responsible for two other wellknown series quick amp flupke 1930–1940 and the adventures of jo zette and jocko 1936–1957 his works were executed in his distinct ligne claire drawing style born to a lowermiddleclass family in etterbeek brussels hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to scouting magazines developing his first comic series the adventures of totor for le boyscout belge in 1926 working for the conservative catholic newspaper le vingtième siècle he created the adventures of tintin in 1929 on the advice of its editor norbert wallez revolving around the actions of boy reporter tintin and his dog snowy the series early installments — tintin in the land of the soviets tintin in the congo and tintin in america — were designed as conservative propaganda for children domestically successful after serialisation the stories were published in book form with hergé continuing the series and also developing both the quick amp flupke and jo zette and jocko series for le vingtième siècle influenced by his friend zhang chongren from 1934 hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories resulting in increased realism from the blue lotus onward following the german occupation of belgium in 1940 le vingtième siècle was closed but hergé continued his series in le soir a popular newspaper controlled by the nazi administration after the allied liberation of belgium in 1944 le soir was shut down and its staff — including hergé — accused of having been collaborators an official investigation was launched and although no charges were brought against hergé in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator with raymond leblanc he established tintin magazine in 1946 through which he serialised new adventures of tintin stories as the magazines artistic director he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series such as edgar p jacobs blake and mortimer in 1950 he established studios hergé as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects prominent staff members jacques martin and bob de moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of the adventures of tintin amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage he produced tintin in tibet his personal favourite of his works in later years he became less prolific and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist hergés works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous wellresearched plots they have been the source of a wide range of adaptations in theatre radio television cinema and computer gaming he remains a strong influence on the comic book medium particularly in europe he is widely celebrated in belgium a hergé museum was established in louvainlaneuve in 2009	Belgian comics writer	belgian comics writer	Artists

Corneille Guillaume Beverloo	"<p><b>Corneille – Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo</b> (3 July 1922 – 5 September 2010), better known under his pseudonym <b>Corneille</b>, was a Dutch artist.</p><p>Corneille was born in Liège, Belgium, although his parents were Dutch and moved back to the Netherlands when he was 12. He studied art at the Academy of Art in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. He was one of the founders of the REFLEX movement in 1948 and in 1949 he was also one of the founders of the COBRA movement, which has had great influence on Scandinavian art. He was active within the group from the beginning, not only painting but also publishing poetry in the <i>Cobra magazine</i>. He was a cofounder of the <i>Experimentele Groep in Holland</i>. Corneille was inspired by the drawings of children, and believed in the importance of approaching children with art that connects with their experience. When he heard during a Cobra Museum visit in the nineties that there was an “Art Lending for Children” he talked with the founder <i>Roby Bellemans</i> and asked him to send more information to his home in Paris about this project. He decided to promote the initiative. He started with a support list and persuaded other artists such as Shinkichi Tajiri to sign. </p> <ul class=""gallery mw-gallery-traditional""><li class=""gallerybox"" style=""width: 155px""> <li class=""gallerybox"" style=""width: 155px""> </ul><p>The poetic Corneille was strongly influenced by Miró and Klee. After the group dissolved in 1951 he moved to Paris and began collecting African art. These artifacts became evident in his works, which began to take on a more imaginative style, like landscapes seen from a bird's eye view, exotic birds and stylised forms. His work is in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou.</p><p>Until his death Corneille lived and worked in Paris, and made visits to Israel where he worked with the Jaffa Atelier. </p><p>On 24 September 2003 an exhibition of his prints opened at the Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art, Israel. He died at Auvers-sur-Oise, France. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1375 Cached time: 20220507065428 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.565 seconds Real time usage: 0.777 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 2211/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 18803/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 2574/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 20/100 Expensive parser function count: 2/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 14127/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.293/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5639730/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 609.744 1 -total 48.89% 298.125 1 Template:Infobox_artist 47.76% 291.228 1 Template:Infobox_person 37.70% 229.894 1 Template:Infobox 20.36% 124.125 5 Template:Cite_web 20.19% 123.135 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 15.55% 94.843 1 Template:Short_description 14.23% 86.738 1 Template:Birth_date 10.89% 66.405 20 Template:Main_other 7.38% 45.013 1 Template:Pagetype -->"	corneille – guillaume cornelis van beverloo 3 july 1922 – 5 september 2010 better known under his pseudonym corneille was a dutch artistcorneille was born in liège belgium although his parents were dutch and moved back to the netherlands when he was 12 he studied art at the academy of art in amsterdam in the netherlands he was one of the founders of the reflex movement in 1948 and in 1949 he was also one of the founders of the cobra movement which has had great influence on scandinavian art he was active within the group from the beginning not only painting but also publishing poetry in the cobra magazine he was a cofounder of the experimentele groep in holland corneille was inspired by the drawings of children and believed in the importance of approaching children with art that connects with their experience when he heard during a cobra museum visit in the nineties that there was an “ art lending for children ” he talked with the founder roby bellemans and asked him to send more information to his home in paris about this project he decided to promote the initiative he started with a support list and persuaded other artists such as shinkichi tajiri to sign the poetic corneille was strongly influenced by miró and klee after the group dissolved in 1951 he moved to paris and began collecting african art these artifacts became evident in his works which began to take on a more imaginative style like landscapes seen from a birds eye view exotic birds and stylised forms his work is in the collection of the centre georges pompidouuntil his death corneille lived and worked in paris and made visits to israel where he worked with the jaffa atelier on 24 september 2003 an exhibition of his prints opened at the ramat gan museum of israeli art israel he died at auverssuroise france	Dutch artist of the COBRA movement better known as Corneille (1922-2010)	dutch artist of the cobra movement better known as corneille 19222010	Artists

William Shatner	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>William Alan Shatner</b> (born March 22, 1931) is a Canadian actor. In a career spanning seven decades, he is best known for his portrayal of Captain James T. Kirk of the USS <i>Enterprise</i> in the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise; from the second pilot in 1965 to his final appearance as Kirk in <i>Star Trek Generations</i> (1994). </p><p>Shatner began his screen acting career in Canadian films and television productions before moving into guest-starring roles in various US television shows.

He has written a series of books chronicling his experiences playing Captain Kirk, being a part of <i>Star Trek</i>, and life after <i>Star Trek</i>. He has also co-written several novels set in the <i>Star Trek</i> universe and a series of science fiction novels called <i>TekWar</i> that were adapted for television. Outside <i>Star Trek,</i> Shatner played the eponymous veteran police sergeant in <i>T. J. Hooker</i> (1982–1986) and hosted the reality-based television series <i>Rescue 911</i> (1989–1996), which won a People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Dramatic Series. His appearances as a guest star in two episodes of the television detective series <i>Columbo</i>, almost two decades apart, were among his many such contributions to television shows from the 1970s to the 2010s. </p><p>Shatner's television career after his last appearance as James Kirk embraced comedy, drama and reality shows.

He completed advanced flight training on the F-86 Sabre at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, where he was a distinguished graduate. After completion of this training, Duke served three years as a fighter pilot with the 526th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. After graduating from the Aerospace Research Pilot School in September 1965, he stayed on as an instructor teaching control systems and flying in the F-101 Voodoo, F-104 Starfighter, and T-33 Shooting Star. </p><p>In April 1966, Duke was one of nineteen men selected for NASA's fifth group of astronauts. In 1969, he was a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10. He served as CAPCOM for Apollo 11, the first crewed landing on the Moon. His distinctive Southern drawl became familiar to audiences around the world, as the voice of a Mission Control made nervous by a long landing that almost expended all of the Lunar Module <i>Eagle</i> descent stage's propellant. Duke's first words to the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the Moon were flustered, ""Roger, Twank...Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot!"" </p><p>Duke was backup lunar module pilot on Apollo 13. Shortly before the mission, he caught rubella (German measles) from a friend's child and inadvertently exposed the prime crew to the disease. As Ken Mattingly had no natural immunity to the disease, he was replaced as command module pilot by Jack Swigert. Mattingly was reassigned as command module pilot of Duke's flight, Apollo 16. On this mission, Duke and John Young landed at the Descartes Highlands, and conducted three extravehicular activities (EVAs). He also served as backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 17. Duke retired from NASA on January 1, 1976. </p><p>Following his retirement from NASA, Duke entered the Air Force Reserve and served as a mobilization augmentee to the Commander, USAF Basic Military Training Center, and to the Commander, USAF Recruiting Service. He graduated from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1978. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, and retired in June 1986. He has logged 4,147 hours' flying time, of which 3,632 hours were in jet aircraft, and 265 hours were in space, including 21 hours and 38 minutes of EVA. </p><p>Duke resides in New Braunfels, Texas, and was named Texan of the Year in 2020. He is currently on the board of directors for the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation and previously served for two years as the chairman.

WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey	"<p>The <b>WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey</b> was a large-scale astronomical redshift survey carried out on the 3.9 metre Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) at the Siding Spring Observatory, New South Wales between August 2006 and January 2011. The name stems from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the distribution of galaxies (“the baryon wiggles”).</p><p>The survey measured the redshift of 240,000 galaxies in the Southern sky. Redshift is the increase in the wavelength of light emitted by a galaxy caused by its speed of motion away from an observer on Earth, enabling the distance of the galaxy from Earth to be computed according to Hubble's Law. The redshifts were measured using the AAOmega spectrograph, which can simultaneously analyse 392 galaxy spectra using optical fibres controlled by a robot positioner, providing a superior mapping speed. Suitable targets were primarily selected by the orbiting GALEX satellite and to complete the survey required some 160 clear nights of telescope time. The data enabled a three dimensional computer model of the galaxies to be calculated. The large number of observations makes it possible to study variations in the distribution of the galaxies caused by such features as baryon acoustic oscillations. </p><p>The work was carried out by a core team of 14 Australia-based astronomers led by Chris Blake and including Sarah Brough, Warrick Couch, Karl Glazebrook, Greg Poole, Tamara Davis, Michael Drinkwater, Russell Jurek, Kevin Pimbblet, Matthew Colless, Rob Sharp, Scott Croom, Michael Pracy, David Woods, Barry Madore, Chris Martin and Ted Wyder. The work was done in conjunction with collaborators in Toronto, Canada and at the California Institute of Technology and Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States. </p><p>The underlying purpose of the survey was to improve understanding of the phenomenon of ""dark energy"", proposed as the mechanism for the observed increasing rate of expansion of the universe, contradicting the traditional theories of gravitational attraction. The survey results can be used in conjunction with measurements of Cosmic microwave background (CMB) to provide more accurate estimates of the composition of the universe. The results will also test current theories of gravity by mapping the growth of structure with redshift. Thirdly, detailed analysis of star-formation rates, environments, morphologies and luminosity functions will provide information on galaxy evolution. </p><p>The WiggleZ project was succeeded by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) based on the 2.5 metre telescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico and the Dark Energy Survey based on the 4 metre Blanco telescope in Chile. </p>"	the wigglez dark energy survey was a largescale astronomical redshift survey carried out on the 39 metre angloaustralian telescope aat at the siding spring observatory new south wales between august 2006 and january 2011 the name stems from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the distribution of galaxies “ the baryon wiggles ” the survey measured the redshift of 240000 galaxies in the southern sky redshift is the increase in the wavelength of light emitted by a galaxy caused by its speed of motion away from an observer on earth enabling the distance of the galaxy from earth to be computed according to hubbles law the redshifts were measured using the aaomega spectrograph which can simultaneously analyse 392 galaxy spectra using optical fibres controlled by a robot positioner providing a superior mapping speed suitable targets were primarily selected by the orbiting galex satellite and to complete the survey required some 160 clear nights of telescope time the data enabled a three dimensional computer model of the galaxies to be calculated the large number of observations makes it possible to study variations in the distribution of the galaxies caused by such features as baryon acoustic oscillations the work was carried out by a core team of 14 australiabased astronomers led by chris blake and including sarah brough warrick couch karl glazebrook greg poole tamara davis michael drinkwater russell jurek kevin pimbblet matthew colless rob sharp scott croom michael pracy david woods barry madore chris martin and ted wyder the work was done in conjunction with collaborators in toronto canada and at the california institute of technology and jet propulsion laboratory in the united states the underlying purpose of the survey was to improve understanding of the phenomenon of dark energy proposed as the mechanism for the observed increasing rate of expansion of the universe contradicting the traditional theories of gravitational attraction the survey results can be used in conjunction with measurements of cosmic microwave background cmb to provide more accurate estimates of the composition of the universe the results will also test current theories of gravity by mapping the growth of structure with redshift thirdly detailed analysis of starformation rates environments morphologies and luminosity functions will provide information on galaxy evolution the wigglez project was succeeded by the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey boss based on the 25 metre telescope at apache point observatory new mexico and the dark energy survey based on the 4 metre blanco telescope in chile	scientific astronomy survey	scientific astronomy survey	Astronomical_objects

Next-Generation Transit Survey	<p>The <b>Next-Generation Transit Survey</b> (<b>NGTS</b>) is a ground-based robotic search for exoplanets. The facility is located at Paranal Observatory in the Atacama desert in northern Chile, about 2 km from ESO's Very Large Telescope and 0.5 km from the VISTA Survey Telescope. Science operations began in early 2015. The astronomical survey is managed by a consortium of seven European universities and other academic institutions from Chile, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Prototypes of the array were tested in 2009 and 2010 on La Palma, and from 2012 to 2014 at Geneva Observatory.</p><p>The aim of NGTS is to discover super-Earths and exo-Neptunes transiting relatively bright and nearby stars with an apparent magnitude of up to 13. The survey uses transit photometry, which precisely measures the dimming of a star to detect the presence of a planet when it crosses in front of it. NGTS consists of an array of twelve commercial 0.2-metre telescopes (f/2.8), each equipped with a red-sensitive CCD camera operating in the visible and near-infrared at 600–900 nm. The array covers an instantaneous field of view of 96 square degrees (8 deg<sup>2</sup> per telescope) or around 0.23% of the entire sky. NGTS builds heavily on experience with SuperWASP, using more sensitive detectors, refined software, and larger optics, though having a much smaller field of view. Compared to the <i>Kepler</i> spacecraft with its original Kepler field of 115 square degrees, the sky area covered by NGTS will be sixteen times larger, because the survey intends to scan four different fields every year over a period of four years. As a result, the sky coverage will be comparable to that of Kepler's K2 phase.</p><p>NGTS is suited to ground-based photometric follow-up of exoplanet candidates from space-based telescopes such as TESS, <i>Gaia</i> and PLATO. In turn, larger instruments such as HARPS, ESPRESSO and VLT-SPHERE may follow-up on NGTS discoveries with a detailed characterization to measure the mass of a large number of targets using Doppler spectroscopy (wobble method) and make it possible to determine the exoplanet's density, and hence whether it is gaseous or rocky. This detailed characterization allows to fill the gap between Earth-sized planets and gas giants as other ground-based surveys can only detect Jupiter-sized exoplanets, and <i>Kepler</i><span>'</span>s Earth-sized planets are often too far away or orbit stars too dim to allow for the planet's mass determination.

Its main task will be carrying out a synoptic astronomical survey, the <b>Legacy Survey of Space and Time</b> (<b>LSST</b>). The word <i>synoptic</i> is derived from the Greek words σύν (syn ""together"") and ὄψις (opsis ""view""), and describes observations that give a broad view of a subject at a particular time. The observatory is located on the El Peñón peak of Cerro Pachón, a 2,682-meter-high mountain in Coquimbo Region, in northern Chile, alongside the existing Gemini South and Southern Astrophysical Research Telescopes. The LSST Base Facility is located about 100 kilometres (62 mi) away by road, in the town of La Serena. The observatory is named for Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who pioneered discoveries about galaxy rotation rates. </p><p>The Rubin Observatory will house the <b>Simonyi Survey Telescope</b>, a wide-field reflecting telescope with an 8.4-meter primary mirror that will photograph the entire available sky every few nights.

The ASAS-South, located in Chile and ASAS-North, located in Hawai'i, are managed by Grzegorz Pojmański of the Warsaw University Observatory via the internet.</p><p>The idea was initiated by the Polish astronomy Professor Bohdan Paczyński of Princeton University. The prototype instrument and data pipeline were designed and built by Grzegorz Pojmański. The work on the ASAS program began in 1996 with a mere $1 million budget. The automatic telescope, located in Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, was designed to register the brightness of circa one million stars in the Southern Hemisphere. However, it proved very efficient and helped to find many new variable stars. The project was then expanded, and now operates four telescopes located in Las Campanas Observatory. The Chilean observatory is operated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.</p><p>So far, ASAS has discovered 50,000 variables located south of declination +28°, which means that it has covered 3/4 of all the sky.

The Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center built the IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo sensors respectively. The Orbital Sciences Corporation manufactured the satellite bus and was the location for spacecraft environmental testing. The nominal mission baseline duration was two years after commissioning, and the prime ended in early 2011. The spacecraft and sensors are still healthy and the mission is continuing in its extended mission.</p><p>IBEX is in a Sun-oriented spin-stabilized orbit around the Earth. In June 2011, IBEX was shifted to a new, more efficient, much more stable orbit.

On 19 October 2008 at 17:48 UTC IBEX was launched on a Pegasus XL rocket from an L-1011 aircraft flying about 200 km north of Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. The Pegasus will put it into a 100 km low Earth orbit. Its solid rocket motor will then put it into a highly elliptical 11 degree inclination orbit an apogee of about 320,000 km to put it beyond interference from the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft propulsion system will raise the perigee to 7000 km and leave IBEX in an eight day orbit, spinning at 4 rpm with a sun-facing axis.

List of deep fields	<p>In astronomy, a <b>deep field</b> is an image of a portion of the sky taken with a very long exposure time, in order to detect and study faint objects. The depth of the field refers to the apparent magnitude or the flux of the faintest objects that can be detected in the image. Deep field observations usually cover a small angular area on the sky, because of the large amounts of telescope time required to reach faint flux limits. Deep fields are used primarily to study galaxy evolution and the cosmic evolution of active galactic nuclei, and to detect faint objects at high redshift. Numerous ground-based and space-based observatories have taken deep-field observations at wavelengths spanning radio to X-rays. </p><p>The first deep-field image to receive a great deal of public attention was the Hubble Deep Field, observed in 1995 with the WFPC2 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Messier object	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Messier objects</b> are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his <i>Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles</i> (<i>Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters</i>). Because Messier was only interested in finding comets, he created a list of those non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them. The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is known as <i>the Messier catalogue</i>. This catalogue of objects is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier numbers. The catalogue includes most of the astronomical deep-sky objects that can easily be observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere; many Messier objects are popular targets for amateur astronomers.</p><p>A preliminary version first appeared in 1774 in the <i>Memoirs</i> of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1771. The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects which were not yet numbered. Eighteen of the objects were discovered by Messier, the rest being previously observed by other astronomers. By 1780 the catalogue had increased to 70 objects. The final version of the catalogue containing 103 objects was published in 1781 in the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i> for the year 1784. However, due to what was thought for a long time to be the incorrect addition of Messier 102, the total number remained 102. Other astronomers, using side notes in Messier's texts, eventually filled out the list up to 110 objects.</p><p>The catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies. For example, Messier 1 is a supernova remnant, known as the Crab Nebula, and the great spiral Andromeda Galaxy is M31. Further inclusions followed, the first addition came from Nicolas Camille Flammarion in 1921, who added Messier 104 after finding Messier's side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue.

AINUR	<p>The <i><b>Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings</b></i> (AINUR) is a catalogue of nuclear rings, which are enormous star-forming ring-shaped regions that circle certain galactic nuclei. The first edition of the atlas was published in 2010 in the <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>, and includes 113 such rings in 107 galaxies. The catalogue resulted from a joint study by researchers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) and the universities of La Laguna, Oulu and Alabama led by Sébastien Comerón from the IAC. </p><p>Nuclear rings are star-forming configurations around galactic nuclei. They may vary in diameter from 500 to 3,000 light years, and are relatively bright due to an abundance of young stars, some of which are extremely massive and consequently enjoy short, very bright lives before ending as supernovae. Most of these rings are associated with Lindblad resonance (after Bertil Lindblad) which is a gravitational effect that nudges matter into preferred orbits. </p> 	the atlas of images of nuclear rings ainur is a catalogue of nuclear rings which are enormous starforming ringshaped regions that circle certain galactic nuclei the first edition of the atlas was published in 2010 in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society and includes 113 such rings in 107 galaxies the catalogue resulted from a joint study by researchers from the institute of astrophysics of the canary islands iac and the universities of la laguna oulu and alabama led by sébastien comerón from the iac nuclear rings are starforming configurations around galactic nuclei they may vary in diameter from 500 to 3000 light years and are relatively bright due to an abundance of young stars some of which are extremely massive and consequently enjoy short very bright lives before ending as supernovae most of these rings are associated with lindblad resonance after bertil lindblad which is a gravitational effect that nudges matter into preferred orbits	star catalogue	star catalogue	Astronomical_objects

The list was compiled by Patrick Moore as a complement to the Messier catalogue.</p><p>While the Messier catalogue is used by amateur astronomers as a list of deep-sky objects for observation, Moore noted that Messier's list was not compiled for that purpose and excluded many of the sky's brightest deep-sky objects, such as the Hyades, the Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884), and the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253). The Messier catalogue was actually compiled as a list of known objects that might be confused with comets.

Comet	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>comet</b> is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process that is called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions. </p><p>Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition. </p><p>Comets are distinguished from asteroids by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets. In the early 21st century, the discovery of some minor bodies with long-period comet orbits, but characteristics of inner solar system asteroids, were called Manx comets. They are still classified as comets, such as C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). 27 Manx comets were found from 2013 to 2017.</p><p>As of November 2021 there are 4584 known comets. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of the total potential comet population, as the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer Solar System (in the Oort cloud) is estimated to be one trillion. Roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye, though many of those are faint and unspectacular. Particularly bright examples are called ""great comets"". Comets have been visited by unmanned probes such as the European Space Agency's <i>Rosetta</i>, which became the first to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet, and NASA's <i>Deep Impact</i>, which blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1316 Cached time: 20220514100516 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.480 seconds Real time usage: 0.575 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1221/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 28278/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1544/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 21/100 Expensive parser function count: 13/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 22662/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.293/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5453964/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 534.246 1 -total 20.16% 107.709 3 Template:Cite_book 17.42% 93.053 1 Template:Short_description 17.06% 91.145 1 Template:Pp-pc1 10.55% 56.346 1 Template:Pagetype 9.95% 53.140 5 Template:Main_other 7.07% 37.769 1 Template:Good_article 6.58% 35.150 1 Template:Top_icon 6.31% 33.726 1 Template:Multiple_image 5.99% 31.987 1 Template:About -->"	a comet is an icy small solar system body that when passing close to the sun warms and begins to release gases a process that is called outgassing this produces a visible atmosphere or coma and sometimes also a tail these phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice dust and small rocky particles the coma may be up to 15 times earths diameter while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit if sufficiently bright a comet may be seen from earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° 60 moons across the sky comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits and they have a wide range of orbital periods ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years shortperiod comets originate in the kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc which lie beyond the orbit of neptune longperiod comets are thought to originate in the oort cloud a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star longperiod comets are set in motion towards the sun from the oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner solar system before being flung to interstellar space the appearance of a comet is called an apparition comets are distinguished from asteroids by the presence of an extended gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus this atmosphere has parts termed the coma the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus and the tail a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the suns light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma however extinct comets that have passed close to the sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets having formed inside the orbit of jupiter rather than in the outer solar system the discovery of mainbelt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets in the early 21st century the discovery of some minor bodies with longperiod comet orbits but characteristics of inner solar system asteroids were called manx comets they are still classified as comets such as c2014 s3 panstarrs 27 manx comets were found from 2013 to 2017as of november 2021 there are 4584 known comets however this represents only a tiny fraction of the total potential comet population as the reservoir of cometlike bodies in the outer solar system in the oort cloud is estimated to be one trillion roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye though many of those are faint and unspectacular particularly bright examples are called great comets comets have been visited by unmanned probes such as the european space agencys rosetta which became the first to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet and nasas deep impact which blasted a crater on comet tempel 1 to study its interior	icy small astronomical object	icy small astronomical object	Astronomical_objects
Megamaser	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>megamaser</b> is a type of astrophysical maser, which is a naturally occurring source of stimulated spectral line emission. Megamasers are distinguished from other astrophysical masers by their large isotropic luminosity. Megamasers have typical luminosities of 10<sup>3</sup> solar luminosities (<var>L</var><sub>☉</sub>), which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the Milky Way, hence the prefix mega. Likewise, the term <b>kilomaser</b> is used to describe masers outside the Milky Way that have luminosities of order <var>L</var><sub>☉</sub>, or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, <b>gigamaser</b> is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, and <b>extragalactic maser</b> encompasses all masers found outside the Milky Way. Most known extragalactic masers are megamasers, and the majority of megamasers are hydroxyl (OH) megamasers, meaning the spectral line being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule. There are known megamasers for three other molecules: water (H<sub>2</sub>O), formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO), and methine (CH). </p><p>Water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, and there are a small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way. </p><p>Water megamasers and kilomasers are found primarily associated with active galactic nuclei, while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers are found in star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers do not seem to be very different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant. </p>"	a megamaser is a type of astrophysical maser which is a naturally occurring source of stimulated spectral line emission megamasers are distinguished from other astrophysical masers by their large isotropic luminosity megamasers have typical luminosities of 103 solar luminosities l☉ which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the milky way hence the prefix mega likewise the term kilomaser is used to describe masers outside the milky way that have luminosities of order l☉ or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the milky way gigamaser is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the milky way and extragalactic maser encompasses all masers found outside the milky way most known extragalactic masers are megamasers and the majority of megamasers are hydroxyl oh megamasers meaning the spectral line being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule there are known megamasers for three other molecules water h2o formaldehyde h2co and methine ch water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered the first water megamaser was found in 1979 in ngc 4945 a galaxy in the nearby centaurus am83 group the first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in arp 220 which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the milky way all subsequent oh megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies and there are a small number of oh kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy and are undergoing a burst of star formation many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the milky way including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies the population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and reemission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions and this application represents the first detection of zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the milky way water megamasers and kilomasers are found primarily associated with active galactic nuclei while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers are found in star forming regions despite different environments the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers do not seem to be very different from those that produce galactic water masers observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the hubble constant	type of astrophysical maser with large isotropic luminosity	type of astrophysical maser with large isotropic luminosity	Astronomical_objects
Cosmic microwave background	"<p>The <b>cosmic microwave background</b> (<b>CMB, CMBR</b>), in Big Bang cosmology, is electromagnetic radiation which is a remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as ""relic radiation"". The CMB is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space. It is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination. With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise, or glow, almost isotropic, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1965 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. </p><p>CMB is landmark evidence of the Big Bang origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with an opaque fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded the plasma grew cooler and the radiation filling it expanded to longer wavelengths. When the temperature had dropped enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the plasma, these newly conceived atoms could not scatter the thermal radiation by Thomson scattering, and so the universe became transparent. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the <i>recombination epoch</i>, and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space is referred to as photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This is the source of the alternative term <i>relic radiation</i>. The <i>surface of last scattering</i> refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling. </p>"	the cosmic microwave background cmb cmbr in big bang cosmology is electromagnetic radiation which is a remnant from an early stage of the universe also known as relic radiation the cmb is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space it is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe dating to the epoch of recombination with a traditional optical telescope the space between stars and galaxies the background is completely dark however a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise or glow almost isotropic that is not associated with any star galaxy or other object this glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum the accidental discovery of the cmb in 1965 by american radio astronomers arno penzias and robert wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s and earned the discoverers the 1978 nobel prize in physics cmb is landmark evidence of the big bang origin of the universe when the universe was young before the formation of stars and planets it was denser much hotter and filled with an opaque fog of hydrogen plasma as the universe expanded the plasma grew cooler and the radiation filling it expanded to longer wavelengths when the temperature had dropped enough protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms unlike the plasma these newly conceived atoms could not scatter the thermal radiation by thomson scattering and so the universe became transparent cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space is referred to as photon decoupling the photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since though growing less energetic since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to plancks relation this is the source of the alternative term relic radiation the surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling	type of thermal radiation; cosmic background radiation that is fundamental to observational cosmology because it is the oldest light in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination	type of thermal radiation cosmic background radiation that is fundamental to observational cosmology because it is the oldest light in the universe dating to the epoch of recombination	Astronomical_objects
Cosmic noise	<p><b>Cosmic noise</b>, also known as <b>galactic radio noise</b>, is not actually sound, but a physical phenomenon derived from outside of the Earth's atmosphere. It can be detected through a radio receiver, which is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information given by them to an audible form. Its characteristics are comparable to those of thermal noise. Cosmic noise occurs at frequencies above about 15 MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or other regions of the sky, such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Celestial objects like quasars, which are super dense objects far from Earth, emit electromagnetic waves in their full spectrum, including radio waves. The fall of a meteorite can also be heard through a radio receiver; the falling object burns from friction with the Earth's atmosphere, ionizing surrounding gases and producing radio waves. Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) from outer space is also a form of cosmic noise. CMBR is thought to be a relic of the Big Bang, and pervades the space almost homogeneously over the entire celestial sphere. The bandwidth of the CMBR is wide, though the peak is in the microwave range. </p>	cosmic noise also known as galactic radio noise is not actually sound but a physical phenomenon derived from outside of the earths atmosphere it can be detected through a radio receiver which is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information given by them to an audible form its characteristics are comparable to those of thermal noise cosmic noise occurs at frequencies above about 15 mhz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or other regions of the sky such as the center of the milky way galaxy celestial objects like quasars which are super dense objects far from earth emit electromagnetic waves in their full spectrum including radio waves the fall of a meteorite can also be heard through a radio receiver the falling object burns from friction with the earths atmosphere ionizing surrounding gases and producing radio waves cosmic microwave background radiation cmbr from outer space is also a form of cosmic noise cmbr is thought to be a relic of the big bang and pervades the space almost homogeneously over the entire celestial sphere the bandwidth of the cmbr is wide though the peak is in the microwave range	random radio noise that originates outside the Earth's atmosphere	random radio noise that originates outside the earths atmosphere	Astronomical_objects

The sources were arranged by constellation and the letter assigned to them was arbitrary, with A denoting the brightest radio source within the constellation.

Black hole bomb	<p>A <b>black hole bomb</b> is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole can be amplified through superradiant scattering. If the amplified field is reflected back towards the black hole, the amplification can be repeated, leading to a run-away growth of the field, i.e. an explosion. One way this reflection could be realized in nature is if the bosonic field has mass. The mass of the field can then cause the amplified modes to be trapped around the black hole, leading to an endless cycle of self-amplification. The mechanism by which the black hole bomb functions is called <b>superradiant instability</b>. It can also refer to one such method of creating such a runaway effect, a Penrose sphere with no means for energy to passively escape. </p>	a black hole bomb is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole can be amplified through superradiant scattering if the amplified field is reflected back towards the black hole the amplification can be repeated leading to a runaway growth of the field ie an explosion one way this reflection could be realized in nature is if the bosonic field has mass the mass of the field can then cause the amplified modes to be trapped around the black hole leading to an endless cycle of selfamplification the mechanism by which the black hole bomb functions is called superradiant instability it can also refer to one such method of creating such a runaway effect a penrose sphere with no means for energy to passively escape	Physical effect when bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole	physical effect when bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole	Astronomical_objects
Brightest cluster galaxy	<p>A <b>brightest cluster galaxy</b> (<b>BCG</b>) is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies. BCGs include the most massive galaxies in the universe. They are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster, hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well. They are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster X-ray emission.</p><p>Formation scenarios for BCGs include: </p> <ul><li>Cooling flow—Star formation from the central cooling flow in high density cooling centers of X-ray cluster halos.</li></ul><p>The study of accretion populations in BCGs has cast doubt over this theory and astronomers have seen no evidence of cooling flows in radiative cooling clusters. The two remaining theories exhibit healthier prospects. </p> <ul><li>Galactic cannibalism—Galaxies sink to the center of the cluster due to dynamical friction and tidal stripping.</li> <li>Galactic merger—Rapid galactic mergers between several galaxies take place during cluster collapse.</li></ul><p>It is possible to differentiate the cannibalism model from the merging model by considering the formation period of the BCGs. In the cannibalism model, there are numerous small galaxies present in the evolved cluster, whereas in the merging model, a hierarchical cosmological model is expected due to the collapse of clusters. It has been shown that the orbit decay of cluster galaxies is not effective enough to account for the growth of BCGs. The merging model is now generally accepted as the most likely one, but recent observations are at odds with some of its predictions. For example, it has been found that the stellar mass of BCGs was assembled much earlier than the merging model predicts.</p> <p>BCGs are divided into various classes of galaxies: giant ellipticals (gE), D galaxies and cD galaxies. cD and D galaxies both exhibit an extended diffuse envelope surrounding an elliptical-like nucleus akin to regular elliptical galaxies. The light profiles of BCGs are often described by a Sersic surface brightness law, a double Sersic profile or a de Vaucouleurs law. The different parametrizations of the light profile of BCG's, as well as the faintness of the diffuse envelope lead to discrepancies in the reported values of the sizes of these objects. </p>	a brightest cluster galaxy bcg is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies bcgs include the most massive galaxies in the universe they are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well they are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster xray emissionformation scenarios for bcgs include cooling flow—star formation from the central cooling flow in high density cooling centers of xray cluster halosthe study of accretion populations in bcgs has cast doubt over this theory and astronomers have seen no evidence of cooling flows in radiative cooling clusters the two remaining theories exhibit healthier prospects galactic cannibalism—galaxies sink to the center of the cluster due to dynamical friction and tidal stripping galactic merger—rapid galactic mergers between several galaxies take place during cluster collapseit is possible to differentiate the cannibalism model from the merging model by considering the formation period of the bcgs in the cannibalism model there are numerous small galaxies present in the evolved cluster whereas in the merging model a hierarchical cosmological model is expected due to the collapse of clusters it has been shown that the orbit decay of cluster galaxies is not effective enough to account for the growth of bcgs the merging model is now generally accepted as the most likely one but recent observations are at odds with some of its predictions for example it has been found that the stellar mass of bcgs was assembled much earlier than the merging model predicts bcgs are divided into various classes of galaxies giant ellipticals ge d galaxies and cd galaxies cd and d galaxies both exhibit an extended diffuse envelope surrounding an ellipticallike nucleus akin to regular elliptical galaxies the light profiles of bcgs are often described by a sersic surface brightness law a double sersic profile or a de vaucouleurs law the different parametrizations of the light profile of bcgs as well as the faintness of the diffuse envelope lead to discrepancies in the reported values of the sizes of these objects	brightest galaxy within a galaxy cluster	brightest galaxy within a galaxy cluster	Astronomical_objects
Spin-flip	<p>A <b>black hole spin-flip</b> occurs when the spin axis of a rotating black hole undergoes a sudden change in orientation due to absorption of a second (smaller) black hole. Spin-flips are believed to be a consequence of galaxy mergers, when two supermassive black holes form a bound pair at the center of the merged galaxy and coalesce after emitting gravitational waves. Spin-flips are significant astrophysically since a number of physical processes are associated with black hole spins; for instance, jets in active galaxies are believed to be launched parallel to the spin axes of supermassive black holes. A change in the rotation axis of a black hole due to a spin-flip would therefore result in a change in the direction of the jet. </p>	a black hole spinflip occurs when the spin axis of a rotating black hole undergoes a sudden change in orientation due to absorption of a second smaller black hole spinflips are believed to be a consequence of galaxy mergers when two supermassive black holes form a bound pair at the center of the merged galaxy and coalesce after emitting gravitational waves spinflips are significant astrophysically since a number of physical processes are associated with black hole spins for instance jets in active galaxies are believed to be launched parallel to the spin axes of supermassive black holes a change in the rotation axis of a black hole due to a spinflip would therefore result in a change in the direction of the jet	phenomenon where the spin axis of a rotating black hole suddenly changes from absorption of a second black hole	phenomenon where the spin axis of a rotating black hole suddenly changes from absorption of a second black hole	Astronomical_objects

Glass	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Glass</b> is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics. Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are ""silicate glasses"" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. The term <i>glass</i>, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology. Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material. </p><p>Although brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria. The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience. Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass. The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials. Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass). </p>"	glass is a noncrystalline often transparent amorphous solid that has widespread practical technological and decorative use in for example window panes tableware and optics glass is most often formed by rapid cooling quenching of the molten form some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring the most familiar and historically the oldest types of manufactured glass are silicate glasses based on the chemical compound silica silicon dioxide or quartz the primary constituent of sand sodalime glass containing around 70 silica accounts for around 90 of manufactured glass the term glass in popular usage is often used to refer only to this type of material although silicafree glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology some objects such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses are so commonly made of silicatebased glass that they are simply called by the name of the material although brittle buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glassmaking cultures archaeological evidence suggests glassmaking dates back to at least 3600 bc in mesopotamia egypt or syria the earliest known glass objects were beads perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience due to its ease of formability into any shape glass has been traditionally used for vessels such as bowls vases bottles jars and drinking glasses in its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights and marbles glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass the refractive reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses prisms and optoelectronics materials extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air or in glassfibre reinforced plastic fibreglass	amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state	amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state	Building
Building developer	<p><b>Real estate development</b>, or <b>property development</b>, is a business process, encompassing activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others. Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities, converting ideas from paper to real property. Real estate development is different from construction or housebuilding, although many developers also manage the construction process or engage in housebuilding. </p><p>Developers buy land, finance real estate deals, build or have builders build projects, develop projects in joint venture, create, imagine, control, and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end. Developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate and receive the greatest rewards. Typically, developers purchase a tract of land, determine the marketing of the property, develop the building program and design, obtain the necessary public approval and financing, build the structures, and rent out, manage, and ultimately sell it.</p><p>Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process. For example, some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price. Alternatively, a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately. </p><p>Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process, including architects, city planners, engineers, surveyors, inspectors, contractors, lawyers, leasing agents, etc. In the Town and Country Planning context in the United Kingdom, 'development' is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s55. </p>	real estate development or property development is a business process encompassing activities that range from the renovation and release of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities converting ideas from paper to real property real estate development is different from construction or housebuilding although many developers also manage the construction process or engage in housebuilding developers buy land finance real estate deals build or have builders build projects develop projects in joint venture create imagine control and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate and receive the greatest rewards typically developers purchase a tract of land determine the marketing of the property develop the building program and design obtain the necessary public approval and financing build the structures and rent out manage and ultimately sell itsometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process for example some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price alternatively a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process including architects city planners engineers surveyors inspectors contractors lawyers leasing agents etc in the town and country planning context in the united kingdom development is defined in the town and country planning act 1990 s55	multifaceted business encompassing activities related to buildings and land	multifaceted business encompassing activities related to buildings and land	Building

Post and lintel	<p>In architecture, <b>post and lintel</b> (also called <b>prop and lintel</b> or a <b>trabeated system</b>) is a building system where strong horizontal elements are held up by strong vertical elements with large spaces between them. This is usually used to hold up a roof, creating a largely open space beneath, for whatever use the building is designed. The horizontal elements are called by a variety of names including lintel, header, architrave or beam, and the supporting vertical elements may be called columns, pillars, or posts. The use of wider elements at the top of the post, called capitals, to help spread the load, is common to many traditions. </p><p>The trabeated system is a fundamental principle of Neolithic architecture, ancient Indian architecture, ancient Greek architecture and ancient Egyptian architecture. Other trabeated styles are the Persian, Lycian, Japanese, traditional Chinese, and ancient Chinese architecture, especially in northern China, and nearly all the Indian styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by Mayan architecture, and in South America by Inca architecture. In all or most of these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings. Timber framing, also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day. </p><p>The biggest disadvantage to a post and lintel construction is the limited weight that can be held up, and the small distances required between the posts. Ancient Roman architecture's development of the arch allowed for much larger structures to be constructed.

Straw-bale construction	"<p><b>Straw-bale construction</b> is a building method that uses bales of straw (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, building insulation, or both. This construction method is commonly used in natural building or ""brown"" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.</p><p>Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value. Disadvantages include susceptibility to rot, difficulty of obtaining insurance coverage, and high space requirements for the straw itself. Research has been done using moisture probes placed within the straw wall in which 7 of 8 locations had moisture contents of less than 20%. This is a moisture level that does not aid in the breakdown of the straw. However, proper construction of the straw-bale wall is important in keeping moisture levels down, just as in the construction of any type of building. </p>"	strawbale construction is a building method that uses bales of straw commonly wheat rice rye and oats straw as structural elements building insulation or both this construction method is commonly used in natural building or brown construction projects research has shown that strawbale construction is a sustainable method for building from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and coolingadvantages of strawbale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw cost easy availability naturally fireretardant and high insulation value disadvantages include susceptibility to rot difficulty of obtaining insurance coverage and high space requirements for the straw itself research has been done using moisture probes placed within the straw wall in which 7 of 8 locations had moisture contents of less than 20 this is a moisture level that does not aid in the breakdown of the straw however proper construction of the strawbale wall is important in keeping moisture levels down just as in the construction of any type of building	building method that uses bales of straw (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, building insulation, or both	building method that uses bales of straw commonly wheat rice rye and oats straw as structural elements building insulation or both	Building
Modular building	<p>A <b>modular building</b> is a prefabricated building that consists of repeated sections called modules. Modularity involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a crane. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing for a variety of configurations and styles. After placement, the modules are joined together using inter-module connections, also known as inter-connections. The inter-connections tie the individual modules together to form the overall building structure.</p>	a modular building is a prefabricated building that consists of repeated sections called modules modularity involves constructing sections away from the building site then delivering them to the intended site installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a crane the modules can be placed sidebyside endtoend or stacked allowing for a variety of configurations and styles after placement the modules are joined together using intermodule connections also known as interconnections the interconnections tie the individual modules together to form the overall building structure	prefabricated building or house that consists of repeated sections	prefabricated building or house that consists of repeated sections	Building
Diagrid	"<p>A <b>diagrid</b> (a portmanteau of <b>diagonal grid</b>) is a framework of diagonally intersecting metal, concrete, or wooden beams that is used in the construction of buildings and roofs.

Green building	<p><b>Green building</b> (also known as <b>green construction</b> or <b>sustainable building</b>) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. In doing so, the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., planet, people and profit across the entire supply chain need to be considered.</p><p>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia. </p><p>Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels. </p><p>Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by: </p> <ul><li>Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</li> <li>Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)</li> <li>Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation</li></ul><p>A similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction. </p><p>A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance.

Roughcast	<p><b>Roughcast</b> or <b>pebbledash</b> is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand, small gravel and often pebbles or shells. The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop. The idea is to maintain an even spread, free from lumps, ridges or runs and without missing any background. Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix, whereas pebbledashing adds them on top. </p><p>According to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> Eleventh Edition (1910–1911), roughcast had been a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings, but it was then frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses, especially those built using timber framing (half timber).

Earthquake-resistant structures	<p><b>Earthquake-resistant or aseismic structures</b> are designed to protect buildings to some or greater extent from earthquakes. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of earthquake-resistant construction is to erect structures that fare better during Seismic activity than their conventional counterparts. According to building codes, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.</p><p>To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively stiff and strong. </p><p>Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Acropolis Museum.</p>	earthquakeresistant or aseismic structures are designed to protect buildings to some or greater extent from earthquakes while no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes the goal of earthquakeresistant construction is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts according to building codes earthquakeresistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location this means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent onesto combat earthquake destruction the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last often by making them excessively stiff and strong currently there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering making use of experimental results computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest these range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations while the former is the method typically applied in most earthquakeresistant structures important facilities landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced and expensive techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage examples of such applications are the cathedral of our lady of the angels and the acropolis museum	structures designed to protect buildings from earthquakes	structures designed to protect buildings from earthquakes	Building

International Building Code	"<p>The <b>International Building Code</b> (<b>IBC</b>) is a model building code developed by the International Code Council (ICC).

The IBC addresses both health and safety concerns for buildings based upon prescriptive and performance related requirements. The IBC is fully compatible with all other published ICC codes. The code provisions are intended to protect public health and safety while avoiding both unnecessary costs and preferential treatment of specific materials or methods of construction. However, a 2019 New York Times story revealed a secret agreement with the National Association of Home Builders that allowed the industry group, which represents the construction industry, to limit improvements in the code that would make buildings more environmentally sustainable and resistant to natural disasters, prompting a congressional investigation. The ICC, in response to a Congressional inquiry, vehemently denied the characterization of the agreement, noting, ""While home builders are among [our code development] partners, they do not have disproportionate control of the Code Council's model code development process.

Powder coating	<p><b>Powder coating</b> is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. Unlike conventional liquid paint which is delivered via an evaporating solvent, powder coating is typically applied electrostatically and then cured under heat or with ultraviolet light. The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminium extrusions, drum hardware, automobiles, and bicycle frames. Advancements in powder coating technology like UV curable powder coatings allow for other materials such as plastics, composites, carbon fiber, and MDF (medium-density fibreboard) to be powder coated due to the minimum heat and oven dwell time required to process these components.</p>	powder coating is a type of coating that is applied as a freeflowing dry powder unlike conventional liquid paint which is delivered via an evaporating solvent powder coating is typically applied electrostatically and then cured under heat or with ultraviolet light the powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer it is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals such as household appliances aluminium extrusions drum hardware automobiles and bicycle frames advancements in powder coating technology like uv curable powder coatings allow for other materials such as plastics composites carbon fiber and mdf mediumdensity fibreboard to be powder coated due to the minimum heat and oven dwell time required to process these components	coating applied as a free-flowing, dry powder	coating applied as a freeflowing dry powder	Building
Rainscreen	<p>A <b>rainscreen</b> is an exterior wall detail where the siding (wall cladding) stands off from the moisture-resistant surface of an air/water barrier applied to the sheathing to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation. The <i>rainscreen</i> is the cladding or siding itself but the term rainscreen implies a system of building. Ideally the rainscreen prevents the wall air/water barrier from getting wet but because of cladding attachments and penetrations (such as windows and doors) water is likely to reach this point, and hence materials are selected to be moisture tolerant and integrated with flashing. In some cases a rainscreen wall is called a <i>pressure-equalized rainscreen</i> wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize on both sides of the rain screen, but this name has been criticized as being redundant and is only useful to scientists and engineers. </p>	a rainscreen is an exterior wall detail where the siding wall cladding stands off from the moistureresistant surface of an airwater barrier applied to the sheathing to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation the rainscreen is the cladding or siding itself but the term rainscreen implies a system of building ideally the rainscreen prevents the wall airwater barrier from getting wet but because of cladding attachments and penetrations such as windows and doors water is likely to reach this point and hence materials are selected to be moisture tolerant and integrated with flashing in some cases a rainscreen wall is called a pressureequalized rainscreen wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize on both sides of the rain screen but this name has been criticized as being redundant and is only useful to scientists and engineers	form of exterior wall cladding	form of exterior wall cladding	Building

Passive daylighting	"<p><b>Daylighting</b> is the practice of placing windows, skylights, other openings, and reflective surfaces so that sunlight (direct or indirect) can provide effective internal lighting. Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from passive solar heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming/switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting. </p><p>The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation. Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter. </p><p>The source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. ""Direct sunlight"" reaches a site without being scattered within Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is ""diffused daylight"". Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. There is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall (north-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and south-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere) of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn.</p><p>Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summer), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.</p>"	daylighting is the practice of placing windows skylights other openings and reflective surfaces so that sunlight direct or indirect can provide effective internal lighting particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial electric lighting or from passive solar heating artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimmingswitching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting the amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation computer programs such as radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design the human eyes response to light is nonlinear so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter the source of all daylight is the sun the proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight direct sunlight reaches a site without being scattered within earths atmosphere sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is diffused daylight sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates there is no direct sunlight on the polarside wall northfacing wall in the northern hemisphere and southfacing wall in the southern hemisphere of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the tropic of cancer and south of the tropic of capricorntraditionally houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side but more and larger windows on the equatorial side southfacing wall in the northern hemisphere and northfacing wall in the southern hemisphere equatorialside windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year except in the tropics in summer so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows at higher latitudes during midwinter light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows this may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion light pipes or tubes and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces at fairly low latitudes in summertime windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator	practice of using daylight in building by windows or other openings	practice of using daylight in building by windows or other openings	Building

Awning	<p>An <b>awning</b> or <b>overhang</b> is a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building. It is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic, cotton or polyester yarn, or vinyl laminated to polyester fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium, iron or steel, possibly wood or transparent material (used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer, but that must allow as much light as possible in the winter). The configuration of this structure is something of a truss, space frame or planar frame. Awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting. These aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor. </p><p>The location of an awning on a building may be above a window, a door, or above the area along a sidewalk. With the addition of columns an awning becomes a canopy, which is able to extend further from a building, as in the case of an entrance to a hotel. Restaurants often use awnings broad enough to cover substantial outdoor area for outdoor dining, parties, or reception. In commercial buildings, an awning is often painted with information as to the name, business, and address, thus acting as a sign or billboard as well as providing shade, breaking strong winds, and protecting from rain or snow. In areas with wintry weather, most awnings do not have to be taken down at the end of the summer – they can remain retracted against the building all winter long, or be designed and built for those conditions. </p> 	an awning or overhang is a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building it is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic cotton or polyester yarn or vinyl laminated to polyester fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium iron or steel possibly wood or transparent material used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer but that must allow as much light as possible in the winter the configuration of this structure is something of a truss space frame or planar frame awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting these aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor the location of an awning on a building may be above a window a door or above the area along a sidewalk with the addition of columns an awning becomes a canopy which is able to extend further from a building as in the case of an entrance to a hotel restaurants often use awnings broad enough to cover substantial outdoor area for outdoor dining parties or reception in commercial buildings an awning is often painted with information as to the name business and address thus acting as a sign or billboard as well as providing shade breaking strong winds and protecting from rain or snow in areas with wintry weather most awnings do not have to be taken down at the end of the summer – they can remain retracted against the building all winter long or be designed and built for those conditions	secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building	secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building	Building

Underfloor air distribution	<p><b>Underfloor air distribution</b> (UFAD) is an air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning in buildings as part of the design of a HVAC system. UFAD systems use an underfloor supply plenum located between the structural concrete slab and a raised floor system to supply conditioned air through floor diffusers directly into the occupied zone of the building. UFAD systems are similar to conventional overhead systems (OH) in terms of the types of equipment used at the cooling and heating plants and primary air-handling units (AHU). Key differences include the use of an underfloor air supply plenum, warmer supply air temperatures, localized air distribution (with or without individual control) and thermal stratification. Thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristics of UFAD systems, which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems (OH). UFAD cooling load profile is different from a traditional OH system due to the impact of raised floor, particularly UFAD may have a higher peak cooling load than that of OH systems. This is because heat is gained from building penetrations and gaps within the structure itself. UFAD has several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems, including layout flexibility, improved thermal comfort and ventilation efficiency, reduced energy use in suitable climates and life-cycle costs. UFAD is often used in office buildings, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where raised floors are desirable for cable management. UFAD is appropriate for a number of different building types including commercials, schools, churches, airports, museums, libraries etc. Notable buildings using UFAD system in North America include The New York Times Building, Bank of America Tower and San Francisco Federal Building. Careful considerations need to be made in the construction phase of UFAD systems to ensure a well-sealed plenum to avoid air leakage in UFAD supply plenums. </p>	underfloor air distribution ufad is an air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning in buildings as part of the design of a hvac system ufad systems use an underfloor supply plenum located between the structural concrete slab and a raised floor system to supply conditioned air through floor diffusers directly into the occupied zone of the building ufad systems are similar to conventional overhead systems oh in terms of the types of equipment used at the cooling and heating plants and primary airhandling units ahu key differences include the use of an underfloor air supply plenum warmer supply air temperatures localized air distribution with or without individual control and thermal stratification thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristics of ufad systems which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems oh ufad cooling load profile is different from a traditional oh system due to the impact of raised floor particularly ufad may have a higher peak cooling load than that of oh systems this is because heat is gained from building penetrations and gaps within the structure itself ufad has several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems including layout flexibility improved thermal comfort and ventilation efficiency reduced energy use in suitable climates and lifecycle costs ufad is often used in office buildings particularly highlyreconfigurable and open plan offices where raised floors are desirable for cable management ufad is appropriate for a number of different building types including commercials schools churches airports museums libraries etc notable buildings using ufad system in north america include the new york times building bank of america tower and san francisco federal building careful considerations need to be made in the construction phase of ufad systems to ensure a wellsealed plenum to avoid air leakage in ufad supply plenums	air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning	air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning	Building

Within this category, it is practical to distinguish between high temperature radiant heating (devices with emitting source temperature &gt;≈300 °F), and radiant heating or cooling with more moderate source temperatures. This article mainly addresses radiant heating and cooling with moderate source temperatures, used to heat or cool indoor environments.

Green building	<p><b>Green building</b> (also known as <b>green construction</b> or <b>sustainable building</b>) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. In doing so, the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., planet, people and profit across the entire supply chain need to be considered.</p><p>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia. </p><p>Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels. </p><p>Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by: </p> <ul><li>Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</li> <li>Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)</li> <li>Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation</li></ul><p>A similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment.

Zero-energy building	"<p>A <b>Zero Energy Building</b> (ZEB), also known as a <b>Net Zero Energy</b> (NZE) building, or a <b>Zero Net Energy</b> (ZNE) building, is a building with net zero energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site or in other definitions by renewable energy sources offsite, using technology such as heat pumps, high efficiency windows and insulation, and solar panels. The goal is that these buildings contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere during operations than similar non-ZNE buildings. They do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases, but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount. Zero-energy buildings are not only driven by a want to have less of an impact on the environment, but they are also driven by money.

Passive cooling	<p><b>Passive cooling</b> is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or no energy consumption. This approach works either by preventing heat from entering the interior (heat gain prevention) or by removing heat from the building (natural cooling).</p><p>Natural cooling utilizes on-site energy, available from the natural environment, combined with the architectural design of building components (e.g. building envelope), rather than mechanical systems to dissipate heat. Therefore, natural cooling depends not only on the architectural design of the building but on how the site's natural resources are used as heat sinks (i.e. everything that absorbs or dissipates heat). Examples of on-site heat sinks are the upper atmosphere (night sky), the outdoor air (wind), and the earth/soil. </p><p>Passive cooling is an important tool for design of buildings for climate change adaptation – reducing dependency on energy-intensive air conditioning in warming environments.</p>	passive cooling is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or no energy consumption this approach works either by preventing heat from entering the interior heat gain prevention or by removing heat from the building natural coolingnatural cooling utilizes onsite energy available from the natural environment combined with the architectural design of building components eg building envelope rather than mechanical systems to dissipate heat therefore natural cooling depends not only on the architectural design of the building but on how the sites natural resources are used as heat sinks ie everything that absorbs or dissipates heat examples of onsite heat sinks are the upper atmosphere night sky the outdoor air wind and the earthsoil passive cooling is an important tool for design of buildings for climate change adaptation – reducing dependency on energyintensive air conditioning in warming environments	any cooling method that facilitates heat dissipation without additional energy input	any cooling method that facilitates heat dissipation without additional energy input	Building

The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design. Although it is principally applied to new buildings, it has also been used for refurbishments. </p><p>By late 2008, estimates of the number of Passive house buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures.

Off-the-grid	"<p><b>Off-the-grid</b> or <b>off-grid</b> is a characteristic of buildings and a lifestyle designed in an independent manner without reliance on one or more public utilities. The term ""off-the-grid"" traditionally refers to not being connected to the electrical grid, but can also include other utilities like water, gas, and sewer systems, and can scale from residential homes to small communities. Off-the-grid living allows for buildings and people to be self-sufficient, which is advantageous in isolated locations where normal utilities cannot reach and is attractive to those who want to reduce environmental impact and cost of living. Generally, an off-grid building must be able to supply energy and potable water for itself, as well as manage food, waste and wastewater. </p>"	offthegrid or offgrid is a characteristic of buildings and a lifestyle designed in an independent manner without reliance on one or more public utilities the term offthegrid traditionally refers to not being connected to the electrical grid but can also include other utilities like water gas and sewer systems and can scale from residential homes to small communities offthegrid living allows for buildings and people to be selfsufficient which is advantageous in isolated locations where normal utilities can not reach and is attractive to those who want to reduce environmental impact and cost of living generally an offgrid building must be able to supply energy and potable water for itself as well as manage food waste and wastewater	systems, especially housing, not connected to the electrical grid	systems especially housing not connected to the electrical grid	Building
Overillumination	<p><b>Overillumination</b> is the presence of lighting intensity higher than that which is appropriate for a specific activity. Overillumination was commonly ignored between 1950 and 1995, especially in office and retail environments. Since then, however, the interior design community has begun to reconsider this practice. Overillumination encompasses two separate concerns: </p> <ul><li>Unnecessary electric lighting is expensive and energy-intensive. Lighting accounts for approximately 9% of residential electricity use as of 2001 and about 40% of commercial electricity use.</li> <li>Excessive levels of artificial light may adversely affect health. These detrimental effects may depend on the spectrum as well as the overall brightness level of light.</li></ul><p>Overillumination can be reduced by installing occupancy sensors, using natural sunlight whenever possible, turning off lights when leaving a room, or changing the type of lightbulb. Overillumination does not refer to snowblindness, where high exposure to ultraviolet light causes physical damage to the eye. Underillumination (too little light; the opposite of overillumination) is associated with seasonal affective disorder. </p>	overillumination is the presence of lighting intensity higher than that which is appropriate for a specific activity overillumination was commonly ignored between 1950 and 1995 especially in office and retail environments since then however the interior design community has begun to reconsider this practice overillumination encompasses two separate concerns unnecessary electric lighting is expensive and energyintensive lighting accounts for approximately 9 of residential electricity use as of 2001 and about 40 of commercial electricity use excessive levels of artificial light may adversely affect health these detrimental effects may depend on the spectrum as well as the overall brightness level of lightoverillumination can be reduced by installing occupancy sensors using natural sunlight whenever possible turning off lights when leaving a room or changing the type of lightbulb overillumination does not refer to snowblindness where high exposure to ultraviolet light causes physical damage to the eye underillumination too little light the opposite of overillumination is associated with seasonal affective disorder	Building science	building science	Building

Different administrative districts (country/state/city etc) mandate different energy-efficiency standards. Quadruple glazing may be required to achieve the desired energy efficiency levels in arctic regions, or to allow for higher glazing ratios in curtain walling without increasing winter heat loss. Quadruple glazing allows building glazing elements to be designed without modulated external sun-shading, given that the low thermal transmittance of having four or more glazing layers enables solar gain to be adequately managed directly by the window glazing itself.

Arborloo	<p>An <b>arborloo</b> is a simple type of composting toilet in which feces are collected in a shallow pit and a fruit tree is later planted in the fertile soil of the full pit. Arborloos have: a pit like a pit latrine but less deep; a concrete, ferrocement or other strong floor; a superstructure (toilet house or outhouse) to provide privacy; and possibly a ring beam to protect the pit from collapsing. The pit should remain well above the water table in the soil, so as to not contaminate groundwater. </p><p>The arborloo works by temporarily putting the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while it fills. Feces, urine, paper, leaves, other materials for wiping, and potentially anal wash water all go into the pit. After each use, a cup of the excavated soil should be added to help to control smell and flies. When the pit is nearly full, the outhouse and slab are moved to a newly dug pit and the old pit is covered with some of the earth from the new pit and left to compost. A fruit tree or other useful vegetation is planted in the old pit, preferably during the rainy season.</p><p>Feces are safely stored and converted in the soil, avoiding disease transmission, and do not have to be processed or manipulated by anyone. Instead, fruits on trees are grown, fertilised by human excreta. </p><p>The arborloo is a type of dry toilet. By using the nutrient-rich soil of a retired pit, the arborloo, in effect, treats feces as a resource rather than a waste product.

Passive daylighting	"<p><b>Daylighting</b> is the practice of placing windows, skylights, other openings, and reflective surfaces so that sunlight (direct or indirect) can provide effective internal lighting. Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from passive solar heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming/switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting. </p><p>The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation. Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter. </p><p>The source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. ""Direct sunlight"" reaches a site without being scattered within Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is ""diffused daylight"". Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. There is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall (north-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and south-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere) of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn.</p><p>Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summer), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.</p>"	daylighting is the practice of placing windows skylights other openings and reflective surfaces so that sunlight direct or indirect can provide effective internal lighting particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial electric lighting or from passive solar heating artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimmingswitching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting the amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation computer programs such as radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design the human eyes response to light is nonlinear so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter the source of all daylight is the sun the proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight direct sunlight reaches a site without being scattered within earths atmosphere sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is diffused daylight sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates there is no direct sunlight on the polarside wall northfacing wall in the northern hemisphere and southfacing wall in the southern hemisphere of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the tropic of cancer and south of the tropic of capricorntraditionally houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side but more and larger windows on the equatorial side southfacing wall in the northern hemisphere and northfacing wall in the southern hemisphere equatorialside windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year except in the tropics in summer so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows at higher latitudes during midwinter light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows this may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion light pipes or tubes and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces at fairly low latitudes in summertime windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator	practice of using daylight in building by windows or other openings	practice of using daylight in building by windows or other openings	Building

Building insulation	<p><b>Building insulation</b> is any object in a building used as insulation for thermal management. While the majority of insulation in buildings is for thermal purposes, the term also applies to acoustic insulation, fire insulation, and impact insulation (e.g. for vibrations caused by industrial applications). Often an insulation material will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once. </p><p>Insulation is an important economic and environmental investment for buildings. By installing insulation, buildings use less energy for heating and cooling and occupants experience less thermal variability. Retrofitting buildings with further insulation is an important climate change mitigation tactic, especially in geographies where energy production is carbon-intensive. Local and national governments and utilities often have a mix of incentives and regulations to encourage insulation efforts on new and renovated buildings as part of efficiency programs in order to reduce grid energy use and its related environmental impacts and infrastructure costs. </p>	building insulation is any object in a building used as insulation for thermal management while the majority of insulation in buildings is for thermal purposes the term also applies to acoustic insulation fire insulation and impact insulation eg for vibrations caused by industrial applications often an insulation material will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once insulation is an important economic and environmental investment for buildings by installing insulation buildings use less energy for heating and cooling and occupants experience less thermal variability retrofitting buildings with further insulation is an important climate change mitigation tactic especially in geographies where energy production is carbonintensive local and national governments and utilities often have a mix of incentives and regulations to encourage insulation efforts on new and renovated buildings as part of efficiency programs in order to reduce grid energy use and its related environmental impacts and infrastructure costs	material used to  thermally insulate buildings	material used to thermally insulate buildings	Building

Passive ventilation	"<p><b>Passive ventilation</b> is the process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using mechanical systems. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure differences arising from natural forces. </p><p>There are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: <i>wind driven ventilation</i> and <i>buoyancy-driven ventilation</i>. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.</p><p>Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes, including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called ""breathing buildings"". </p>"	passive ventilation is the process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using mechanical systems it refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure differences arising from natural forces there are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings wind driven ventilation and buoyancydriven ventilation wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building buoyancydriven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exteriorsince the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes including the heat from people and wind effects are variable naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called breathing buildings	process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using mechanical systems	process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using mechanical systems	Building
Compressed earth block	<p>A <b>compressed earth block</b> (<b>CEB</b>), also known as a <b>pressed earth block</b> or a <b>compressed soil block</b>, is a building material made primarily from an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic subsoil, non-expansive clay, sand, and aggregate. Forming compressed earth blocks requires dampening, mechanically pressing at high pressure, and then drying the resulting material. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as Portland cement they are called <i>compressed stabilized earth block</i> (CSEB) or <i>stabilized earth block</i> (SEB). Typically, around 3,000 psi (21 MPa) is applied in compression, and the original material volume is reduced by about half. </p><p>Creating CEBs differs from rammed earth in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from mud bricks in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB usually exceeds that of typical mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB. </p><p>CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard bricklaying and masonry techniques. The mortar may be a simple slurry made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues.

Green building in Bangladesh	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations in the world due to climate change. As the ninth most populous country and twelfth most densely populated countries in the world, its rising population and limited land space have put tremendous strains on the urban ecosystem. The capital of Dhaka itself underwent severe transformations in recent years to catch up the increased rate of urbanisation. This change was paralleled by a boom in the real estate, construction and housing industry. According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world.</p><p>Unified measures have been adopted from the national community in an effort to avoid further man made calamities due to climate change and higher emissions. There are six main sectors most likely to be affected by climate change in Bangladesh – water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity, fisheries, and human health. Deforestation has resulted in several man made disasters in the country's history. Green buildings assure efficient usage of water and energy and the nation is struggling in the production of electricity and suffering from a shortage of water. </p><p>The First Government Green Building Initiative was taken by the Housing and Building Research Institute in 2007The Eco-Housing Project designed by Ar. Md Nafizur Rahman. With the support of IFC-world bank the HBRI Drafted the Guideline for Grenbuilding Code in 2012, in the same year a new chapter on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability was included in BNBC. The Building Energy and Environment Rating System for Bangladesh has been Drafted by Ar. Md. Nafizur Rahman in 2018 for the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Authority (SREDA)[1] The Bangladesh Bank with te support of SREDA also created a point-based rating system for their Refinancing scheme in 2017. In the private sector, the first green building in Bangladesh was by EPIC group in May 2011. Since 2008, Sustainable Built Environment Initiative – Bangladesh (later Bangladesh Green Building Council) founder, Sanwar Azam had worked to unify the stake holders towards a greener country, saying that with growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanisation to major cities, 'Going green' had become a marketing ploy for various organisations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability. He offered a centralised board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms. In addition, he proposed a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture.</p><p>Azam also stressed the need for educational programs in sustainable designs and various universities in Bangladesh planned to promote Green Building principles in their curriculum, such as in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, State University of Bangladesh-SUB, North South University, BRAC University and Asia Pacific University. Dr. Saleh Uddin was the Events and Education Committee of Bangladesh Green Building Council. Citing that in cramped environment, such buildings and structures would be far more comfortable and satisfying but most importantly directly address some national issues, like conserving water and energy. The Government of Bangladesh in 2009 stopped giving connections to newly constructed buildings meaning that new homes would not have access to energy, and even water due to shortages. Experts agreed that a rating tool would not only facilitate government incentives to sustainable communities but achieve the six-point goals of the National Water Policy of 1999 by the World Bank as well as the Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 by the Ministry of Power and Energy.</p><p>In an event with Architecture and construction experts, he urged for a national need for sustainable development in the nation's growing building industry and brought a forum together to act as the national GBC of Bangladesh. He stressed reductions of carbon emissions from buildings. National and international energy companies like Energpac and Siemens attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative. The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the seventh target from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as for the first time the council provided support for green building certifications. Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. In another interview with <i>The Independent</i>, Sanwar said ""there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction,"" and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. About the feasibility of widespread utilisation of LEED certifications, he said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context. These activities were also promoted by national and region experts. Prominent national award-winning architects such as Mustapha Khalid Palash, the 2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and Rafiq Azam, defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define 'Green' according to the national circumstances. The Institute of Architects Bangladesh, which works with different government organisation to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool.</p><p>In 2011, BGBC founder pointed out that such green building standards and tools will lead to conservation as buildings would less consumption of electricity and water, and also 'the need for reduction of carbon emissions' in the current building and construction scenario. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh spoke about the government's role.

Phase-change material	<p>A <b>phase change material</b> (<b>PCM</b>) is a substance which releases/absorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heat/cooling. Generally the transition will be from one of the first two fundamental states of matter - solid and liquid - to the other. The phase transition may also be between non-classical states of matter, such as the conformity of crystals, where the material goes from conforming to one crystalline structure to conforming to another, which may be a higher or lower energy state. </p><p>The energy released/absorbed by phase transition from solid to liquid, or vice versa, the heat of fusion is generally much higher than the sensible heat. Ice, for example, requires 333.55 J/g to melt, but then water will rise one degree further with the addition of just 4.18 J/g. Water/ice is therefore a very useful phase change material and has been used to store winter cold to cool buildings in summer since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire. </p><p>By melting and solidifying at the phase change temperature (PCT), a PCM is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy compared to sensible heat storage. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa or when the internal structure of the material changes; PCMs are accordingly referred to as latent heat storage (LHS) materials. </p><p>There are two principal classes of phase change material: organic (carbon-containing) materials derived either from petroleum, from plants or from animals; and salt hydrates, which generally either use natural salts from the sea or from mineral deposits or are by-products of other processes. A third class is solid to solid phase change. </p><p>PCMs are used in many different commercial applications where energy storage and/or stable temperatures are required, including, among others, heating pads, cooling for telephone switching boxes, and clothing. </p><p>By far the biggest potential market is for building heating and cooling. In this application area, PCMs hold potential in light of the progressive reduction in the cost of renewable electricity, coupled with the intermittent nature of such electricity. This can result in a misfit between peak demand and availability of supply. In North America, China, Japan, Australia, Southern Europe and other developed countries with hot summers, peak supply is at midday while peak demand is from around 17:00 to 20:00. This creates opportunities for thermal storage media. </p><p>Solid-liquid phase change materials are usually encapsulated for installation in the end application, to contain in the liquid state. In some applications, especially when incorporation to textiles is required, phase change materials are micro-encapsulated. Micro-encapsulation allows the material to remain solid, in the form of small bubbles, when the PCM core has melted. </p>	a phase change material pcm is a substance which releasesabsorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heatcooling generally the transition will be from one of the first two fundamental states of matter solid and liquid to the other the phase transition may also be between nonclassical states of matter such as the conformity of crystals where the material goes from conforming to one crystalline structure to conforming to another which may be a higher or lower energy state the energy releasedabsorbed by phase transition from solid to liquid or vice versa the heat of fusion is generally much higher than the sensible heat ice for example requires 33355 jg to melt but then water will rise one degree further with the addition of just 418 jg waterice is therefore a very useful phase change material and has been used to store winter cold to cool buildings in summer since at least the time of the achaemenid empire by melting and solidifying at the phase change temperature pct a pcm is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy compared to sensible heat storage heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa or when the internal structure of the material changes pcms are accordingly referred to as latent heat storage lhs materials there are two principal classes of phase change material organic carboncontaining materials derived either from petroleum from plants or from animals and salt hydrates which generally either use natural salts from the sea or from mineral deposits or are byproducts of other processes a third class is solid to solid phase change pcms are used in many different commercial applications where energy storage andor stable temperatures are required including among others heating pads cooling for telephone switching boxes and clothing by far the biggest potential market is for building heating and cooling in this application area pcms hold potential in light of the progressive reduction in the cost of renewable electricity coupled with the intermittent nature of such electricity this can result in a misfit between peak demand and availability of supply in north america china japan australia southern europe and other developed countries with hot summers peak supply is at midday while peak demand is from around 1700 to 2000 this creates opportunities for thermal storage media solidliquid phase change materials are usually encapsulated for installation in the end application to contain in the liquid state in some applications especially when incorporation to textiles is required phase change materials are microencapsulated microencapsulation allows the material to remain solid in the form of small bubbles when the pcm core has melted	substance with high latent heat of melting or solidifying	substance with high latent heat of melting or solidifying	Building

Climate change and cities	"<p> <b>Climate change and cities</b> are deeply connected. Cites are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the world's population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportation—two of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.</p><p>Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: SPM-33"">: SPM-33 </span></sup> and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion. </p><p>A report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction (largely due to cement's outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization).In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.</p><p>Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities (such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI) and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 (""sustainable cities and communities""), to activate and focus attention on these solutions. </p>"	climate change and cities are deeply connected cites are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans more than half of the worlds population is in cities consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities the un projects that 68 of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050 hence cities have a significant influence on construction and transportation—two of the key contributors to global warming emissions moreover because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in citiesbecause of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities exacerbating existing problems such as air pollution water scarcity and heat illness in the metropolitan areas moreover because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise which cause coastal flooding spm33 and erosion and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems like subsidence and aquifer depletion a report by the c40 cities climate leadership group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than productionbased emissions within cities the report estimates that 85 of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions for example increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation improving transportation efficiencies and greening construction largely due to cements outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherizationin the most recent past increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include cityfocused solutions for example project drawdown recommends several major urban investments including improved bicycle infrastructure building retrofitting district heating public transit and walkable cities as important solutionsbecause of this the international community has formed coalitions of cities such as the c40 cities climate leadership group and iclei and policy goals such as sustainable development goal 11 sustainable cities and communities to activate and focus attention on these solutions	field of research combining climate change impact and mitigation and cities	field of research combining climate change impact and mitigation and cities	City
City	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>city</b> is a large human settlement. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. </p><p>Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and education. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming, and global health. Because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through Sustainable Development Goal 11. Due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change. However, this concentration can also have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources. </p><p>Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such as Beijing, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, Athens, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C. reflect the identity and apex of their respective nations. Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto and Xi'an, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. Religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Haridwar and Allahabad each hold significance. </p>"	a city is a large human settlement it can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on nonagricultural tasks cities generally have extensive systems for housing transportation sanitation utilities land use production of goods and communication their density facilitates interaction between people government organisations and businesses sometimes benefiting different parties in the process such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution historically citydwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization more than half of the world population now lives in cities which has had profound consequences for global sustainability presentday cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment entertainment and education however in a world of intensifying globalization all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions this increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues such as sustainable development global warming and global health because of these major influences on global issues the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through sustainable development goal 11 due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas therefore compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change however this concentration can also have significant negative consequences such as forming urban heat islands concentrating pollution and stressing water supplies and other resources other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city for example country capitals such as beijing london mexico city moscow nairobi new delhi paris rome athens seoul singapore tokyo and washington dc reflect the identity and apex of their respective nations some historic capitals such as kyoto and xian maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion jerusalem mecca varanasi ayodhya haridwar and allahabad each hold significance	large permanent human settlement	large permanent human settlement	City

Central business district	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>central business district</b> (<b>CBD</b>) is the commercial and business center of a city. It contains commercial space and offices. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's ""financial district"". Geographically, it often coincides with the ""city center"" or ""downtown"". However, these concepts are not mutually exclusive: many cities have a central <i>business</i> district located away from its commercial and or cultural center and or downtown/city center, or even several CBDs at once. The CBD is characterized as the area within a city with the highest accessibility plus having a greater variety and concentration of specialized goods and services than any other area. For instance, London's city center is usually regarded as encompassing the historic City of London and the medieval City of Westminster, while the City of London and the transformed Docklands area containing Canary Wharf are regarded as their two respective CBDs. In New York City, Midtown Manhattan. In Chicago, the Chicago Loop is the second-largest central business district in the United States and in the world. It is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. Mexico City also has its own historic city center, the colonial-era ""Centro Histórico,"" along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma – Polanco, and the new Santa Fe, respectively. Moscow and Russia's largest central business district is the Moscow International Business Center. </p><p>The shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the city center. This practice is quite common for European cities such as Paris, Moscow, or Vienna. In cities in the New World that grew quickly after the invention of modern transportation such as road or rail, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing urbanization in the 21st century have developed megacities, particularly in Asia, that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers. Although no two CBDs look alike in terms of their spatial shape, however, certain geometric patterns in these areas are recurring throughout many cities due to the nature of a centralized commercial and industrial activities.</p>"	a central business district cbd is the commercial and business center of a city it contains commercial space and offices in larger cities it is often synonymous with the citys financial district geographically it often coincides with the city center or downtown however these concepts are not mutually exclusive many cities have a central business district located away from its commercial and or cultural center and or downtowncity center or even several cbds at once the cbd is characterized as the area within a city with the highest accessibility plus having a greater variety and concentration of specialized goods and services than any other area for instance londons city center is usually regarded as encompassing the historic city of london and the medieval city of westminster while the city of london and the transformed docklands area containing canary wharf are regarded as their two respective cbds in new york city midtown manhattan in chicago the chicago loop is the secondlargest central business district in the united states and in the world it is also referred to as the core of the citys downtown mexico city also has its own historic city center the colonialera centro histórico along with two cbds the midlate 20th century paseo de la reforma – polanco and the new santa fe respectively moscow and russias largest central business district is the moscow international business center the shape and type of a cbd almost always closely reflect the citys history cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a cbd quite a distance from the city center this practice is quite common for european cities such as paris moscow or vienna in cities in the new world that grew quickly after the invention of modern transportation such as road or rail a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the regions tallest buildings and act both as the cbd and the commercial and cultural city center increasing urbanization in the 21st century have developed megacities particularly in asia that will often have multiple cbds scattered across the urban area it has been said that downtowns as understood in north america are therefore conceptually distinct from both cbds and city centers although no two cbds look alike in terms of their spatial shape however certain geometric patterns in these areas are recurring throughout many cities due to the nature of a centralized commercial and industrial activities	commercial and business centre of a city	commercial and business centre of a city	City

It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India. The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats a large Hindu Shiva Temple. It is located central of the state, and 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, and was a point of contact for the Assyrians, Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English. </p><p>Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history. The city centre contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy. The city hosts the Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival in Kerala. The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan in April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'.</p><p>Religion is important and varied in Thrissur. The city has historically been a centre of Hindu scholarship, and Christianity, Islam and Judaism are believed to have entered the Indian subcontinent through Thrissur and its surrounding areas. Thrissur has a large number of well-known temples including the Vadakkumnathan temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, Paramekkavu temple, and Guruvayur temple. There are three major Catholic churches, the St. Antony's Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane, Our Lady of Lourdes Syro-Malabar Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral and Our Lady of Dolours Syro-Malabar Catholic Basilica, the largest Christian church in India. India's first mosque, Cheraman Juma Masjid, is believed to have been constructed in 629 CE.</p><p>The city is the headquarters of four major scheduled banks, South Indian Bank Ltd, Catholic Syrian Bank, Dhanalakshmi Bank and ESAF Small Finance Bank as well as several chit funds. The city is also a big centre for silks and gold jewellery.

City network	<p><b>City networks</b> are a geographical concept studying connections between cities by placing the cities as nodes on a network. In modern conceptions of cities, these networks play an important role in understanding the nature of cities. City networks can identify physical connections to other places, such as railways, canals, scheduled flights, or telecommunication networks, typically done using graph theory. City networks also exist in immaterial form, such as trade, global finance, markets, migration, cultural links, shared social spaces or shared histories. There are also networks of religious nature, in particular through pilgrimage. </p><p>The city itself is then regarded as the node where different networks run together.

Suburb	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>suburb</b> (more broadly <b>suburban area</b>) is an area outside of a principal city of a metropolitan area, which may include commercial and mixed-use, but is primarily a residential area. A suburb can exist either as part of a larger city/urban area or as a separate political entity. The name describes an area which is not as densely populated as an inner city, yet more densely populated than a rural area in the countryside. In many metropolitan areas, suburbs exist as separate residential communities within commuting distance of a city (cf ""bedroom suburb"".) Suburbs can have their own political or legal jurisdiction, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom, where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities. In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, <i>suburb</i> has become largely synonymous with what is called a ""neighborhood"" in other countries, and the term encompasses inner city areas.</p><p>In some areas, such as Australia, India, China, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl. In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough. In the United States, regions beyond the suburbs are known as ""exurban areas"" or exurbs; exurbs have less population density than suburbs, but still more than rural areas. Suburbs and exurbs are linked to the nearby larger metropolitan area economically, particularly by commuters. </p><p>Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting. In general, they are less densely populated than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area, and most residents routinely commute to city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transits; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs, planned communities and satellite cities. Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.</p><p>In the United States, suburbs typically have the connotation of being more affluent, educated, and middle-class than city neighborhoods. Suburbs are often culturally distinct from the cities they orbit. The term ""suburbia"" is a mocking or slightly pejorative word for the mass culture of suburbs, calling to mind endless acres of single-family homes surrounded by carefully-mown lawns, with a culture that prizes middle-class conformity and frowns on differences and diversity. </p>"	a suburb more broadly suburban area is an area outside of a principal city of a metropolitan area which may include commercial and mixeduse but is primarily a residential area a suburb can exist either as part of a larger cityurban area or as a separate political entity the name describes an area which is not as densely populated as an inner city yet more densely populated than a rural area in the countryside in many metropolitan areas suburbs exist as separate residential communities within commuting distance of a city cf bedroom suburb suburbs can have their own political or legal jurisdiction especially in the united states but this is not always the case especially in the united kingdom where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities in most englishspeaking countries suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas but in australian english and south african english suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a neighborhood in other countries and the term encompasses inner city areasin some areas such as australia india china new zealand canada the united kingdom and parts of the united states new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl in others such as morocco france and much of the united states many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county district or borough in the united states regions beyond the suburbs are known as exurban areas or exurbs exurbs have less population density than suburbs but still more than rural areas suburbs and exurbs are linked to the nearby larger metropolitan area economically particularly by commuters suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport which led to an increase in commuting in general they are less densely populated than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area and most residents routinely commute to city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transits however there are many exceptions including industrial suburbs planned communities and satellite cities suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat landin the united states suburbs typically have the connotation of being more affluent educated and middleclass than city neighborhoods suburbs are often culturally distinct from the cities they orbit the term suburbia is a mocking or slightly pejorative word for the mass culture of suburbs calling to mind endless acres of singlefamily homes surrounded by carefullymown lawns with a culture that prizes middleclass conformity and frowns on differences and diversity	residential or mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate area	residential or mixed use area either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate area	City
Urbanity	<p><b>Urbanity</b> (<span></span>) may refer to suavity, courteousness, and refinement of manner, or to urban life. It represents characteristics, personality traits, and viewpoints associated with cities and urban areas. People who can be described as having urbanity are sometimes referred to as <i><b>citified</b></i>. The word is related to the Latin <i>urbanitas</i> with connotations of refinement and elegance, the opposite of <i>rusticus</i>, associated with the countryside. In Latin the word referred originally to the view of the world from ancient Rome.

Rural area	<p>In general, a <b>rural area</b> or a <b>countryside</b> is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. Agricultural areas and areas with forestry typically are described as rural. Different countries have varying definitions of <i>rural</i> for statistical and administrative purposes. </p><p>In rural areas, because of their unique economic and social dynamics, and relationship to land-based industry such as agriculture, forestry and resource extraction, the economics are very different from cities and can be subject to boom and bust cycles and vulnerability to extreme weather or natural disasters, such as droughts. These dynamics alongside larger economic forces encouraging to urbanization have led to significant demographic declines, called rural flight, where economic incentives encourage younger populations to go to cities for education and access to jobs, leaving older, less educated and less wealthy populations in the rural areas. Slower economic development results in poorer services like healthcare and education and rural infrastructure. This cycle of poverty in some rural areas, means that three quarters of the global population in poverty live in rural areas according to the Food and Agricultural Organization. </p><p>Some communities have successfully encouraged economic development in rural areas, with some policies such as giving increased access to electricity or internet, proving very successful on encouraging economic activities in rural areas. Historically development policies have focused on larger extractive industries, such as mining and forestry. However, recent approaches more focused on sustainable development are more aware of economic diversification in these communities. </p> 	in general a rural area or a countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements agricultural areas and areas with forestry typically are described as rural different countries have varying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes in rural areas because of their unique economic and social dynamics and relationship to landbased industry such as agriculture forestry and resource extraction the economics are very different from cities and can be subject to boom and bust cycles and vulnerability to extreme weather or natural disasters such as droughts these dynamics alongside larger economic forces encouraging to urbanization have led to significant demographic declines called rural flight where economic incentives encourage younger populations to go to cities for education and access to jobs leaving older less educated and less wealthy populations in the rural areas slower economic development results in poorer services like healthcare and education and rural infrastructure this cycle of poverty in some rural areas means that three quarters of the global population in poverty live in rural areas according to the food and agricultural organization some communities have successfully encouraged economic development in rural areas with some policies such as giving increased access to electricity or internet proving very successful on encouraging economic activities in rural areas historically development policies have focused on larger extractive industries such as mining and forestry however recent approaches more focused on sustainable development are more aware of economic diversification in these communities	geographic area that is located outside towns and cities	geographic area that is located outside towns and cities	City

Town privileges	"<p><b>Town privileges</b> or <b>borough rights</b> were important features of European towns during most of the second millennium. The city law customary in Central Europe probably dates back to Italian models, which in turn were oriented towards the traditions of the self-administration of Roman cities. </p><p>Judicially, a borough (or burgh) was distinguished from the countryside by means of a charter from the ruling monarch that defined its privileges and laws. Common privileges involved trade (marketplace, the storing of goods, etc.) and the establishment of guilds.

Some degree of self-government, representation by diet, and tax-relief could also be granted. Multiple tiers existed; for example, in Sweden, the basic royal charter establishing a borough enabled trade, but not foreign trade, which required a higher-tier charter granting staple right. </p>"	town privileges or borough rights were important features of european towns during most of the second millennium the city law customary in central europe probably dates back to italian models which in turn were oriented towards the traditions of the selfadministration of roman cities judicially a borough or burgh was distinguished from the countryside by means of a charter from the ruling monarch that defined its privileges and laws common privileges involved trade marketplace the storing of goods etc and the establishment of guilds some of these privileges were permanent and could imply that the town obtained the right to be called a borough hence the term borough rights german stadtrecht dutch stadsrechten some degree of selfgovernment representation by diet and taxrelief could also be granted multiple tiers existed for example in sweden the basic royal charter establishing a borough enabled trade but not foreign trade which required a highertier charter granting staple right	features of European towns during most of the second millennium	features of european towns during most of the second millennium	City

City region	<p><b>City region</b> is a term in use since about 1950 by urbanists, economists and urban planners to mean a metropolitan area and hinterland, often having a shared administration. Typically, it denotes a city, conurbation or urban zone with multiple administrative districts, but sharing resources like a central business district, labour market and transport network such that it functions as a single economic unit </p><p>In studying human geography, urban and regional planning or the regional dynamics of business it is often worthwhile to have closer regard to dominant travel patterns during the working day (to the extent that these can be estimated and recorded) than to the rather arbitrary boundaries assigned to administrative bodies such as councils, prefectures, or localities defined merely to optimise postal services. Inevitably, city regions change their shapes over time and quite reasonably, politicians seek to redraw administrative boundaries by perceived geographic reality. The extent of a city region is usually proportional to the intensity of activity in and around its central business district, but the spacing of competing centres of population can also be highly influential. It will be appreciated that a city region need not have a symmetrical shape, and that is especially true in coastal or lakeside situations (such as Oslo, Southampton or Chicago).</p>	city region is a term in use since about 1950 by urbanists economists and urban planners to mean a metropolitan area and hinterland often having a shared administration typically it denotes a city conurbation or urban zone with multiple administrative districts but sharing resources like a central business district labour market and transport network such that it functions as a single economic unit in studying human geography urban and regional planning or the regional dynamics of business it is often worthwhile to have closer regard to dominant travel patterns during the working day to the extent that these can be estimated and recorded than to the rather arbitrary boundaries assigned to administrative bodies such as councils prefectures or localities defined merely to optimise postal services inevitably city regions change their shapes over time and quite reasonably politicians seek to redraw administrative boundaries by perceived geographic reality the extent of a city region is usually proportional to the intensity of activity in and around its central business district but the spacing of competing centres of population can also be highly influential it will be appreciated that a city region need not have a symmetrical shape and that is especially true in coastal or lakeside situations such as oslo southampton or chicago	Urban development model, an area of shared administration	urban development model an area of shared administration	City
City status	"<p><b>City status</b> is a symbolic and legal designation given by a national or subnational government. A municipality may receive city status because it already has the qualities of a city, or because it has some special purpose. </p><p>Historically, city status was a privilege granted by royal letters of patent. The status would allow markets and/or foreign trade, in contrast to towns. Sovereigns could establish cities by decree, e.g. Helsinki, regardless of what was in the location beforehand. Also, with the establishment of federal governments, the new capital could be established from scratch, e.g. Brasília, without going through organic growth from a village to a town. </p> <p>British city status was historically conferred on settlements with a diocesan cathedral; in more recent times towns apply to receive city status at times of national celebration.

Maya city	<p><b>Maya cities</b> were the centres of population of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of Mesoamerica. They served the specialised roles of administration, commerce, manufacturing and religion that characterised ancient cities worldwide. Maya cities tended to be more dispersed than cities in other societies, even within Mesoamerica, as a result of adaptation to a lowland tropical environment that allowed food production amidst areas dedicated to other activities. They lacked the grid plans of the highland cities of central Mexico, such as Teotihuacán and Tenochtitlan. Maya kings ruled their kingdoms from palaces that were situated within the centre of their cities. Cities tended to be located in places that controlled trade routes or that could supply essential products. This allowed the elites that controlled trade to increase their wealth and status. Such cities were able to construct temples for public ceremonies, thus attracting further inhabitants to the city. Those cities that had favourable conditions for food production, combined with access to trade routes, were likely to develop into the capital cities of early Maya states.</p><p>The political relationship between Classic Maya city-states has been likened to the relationships between city-states in Classical Greece and Renaissance Italy. Some cities were linked to each other by straight limestone causeways, known as <i>sacbeob</i>, although whether the exact function of these roads was commercial, political or religious has not been determined.</p>	maya cities were the centres of population of the precolumbian maya civilization of mesoamerica they served the specialised roles of administration commerce manufacturing and religion that characterised ancient cities worldwide maya cities tended to be more dispersed than cities in other societies even within mesoamerica as a result of adaptation to a lowland tropical environment that allowed food production amidst areas dedicated to other activities they lacked the grid plans of the highland cities of central mexico such as teotihuacán and tenochtitlan maya kings ruled their kingdoms from palaces that were situated within the centre of their cities cities tended to be located in places that controlled trade routes or that could supply essential products this allowed the elites that controlled trade to increase their wealth and status such cities were able to construct temples for public ceremonies thus attracting further inhabitants to the city those cities that had favourable conditions for food production combined with access to trade routes were likely to develop into the capital cities of early maya statesthe political relationship between classic maya citystates has been likened to the relationships between citystates in classical greece and renaissance italy some cities were linked to each other by straight limestone causeways known as sacbeob although whether the exact function of these roads was commercial political or religious has not been determined	centres of ancient Mayan civilization in Mesoamerica	centres of ancient mayan civilization in mesoamerica	City

Costermonger	<p>A <b>costermonger</b>, <b>coster</b>, or <b>costard</b> is a street seller of fruit and vegetables in British towns. The term is derived from the words <i>costard</i> (a medieval variety of apple) and <i>monger</i> (seller), and later came to be used to describe hawkers in general. Some historians have pointed out that a hierarchy existed within the costermonger class and that while costermongers sold from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, mere hawkers carried their wares in a basket.</p><p>Costermongers met a need for rapid food distribution from the wholesale markets (e.g., in London: Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish) by providing retail sales at locations that were convenient for the labouring classes. Costermongers used a variety of devices to transport and display produce: a cart might be stationary at a market stall; a mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow) apparatus or a hand-held basket might be used for light-weight goods such as herbs and flowers. </p><p>Costermongers experienced a turbulent history, yet survived numerous attempts to eradicate their class from the streets. Programmes designed to curtail their activities occurred during the reigns of Elizabeth I, Charles I and reached a peak during Victorian times. However, the social cohesion within the coster community, along with sympathetic public support, enabled them to resist efforts to eradicate them. As highly visible, colourful characters who provided service and convenience to the labouring classes, costermongers enjoyed a high level of public sympathy at times when they came under attack from authorities. </p><p>They became known for their melodic sales patter, poems and chants, which they used to attract attention. Both the sound and appearance of costermongers contributed to a distinctive street life that characterised London and other large European cities, including Paris, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their loud sing-song cry or chants used to attract attention became part of the fabric of street life in large cities in Britain and Europe. Costermongers exhibited a distinct identity. Individuals signalled membership of the coster community through a dress code, especially the large neckerchief, known as a <i>kingsman</i>, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. The distinctive identity and culture of costermongers led to considerable appeal as subject-matter for artists, dramatists, comedians, writers and musicians. Parodies of the costermonger and his way of life were frequent features in Victorian music halls. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, but their numbers began to decline in the second half of the 20th century when they began to take up pitches in the regulated markets. </p>	a costermonger coster or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables in british towns the term is derived from the words costard a medieval variety of apple and monger seller and later came to be used to describe hawkers in general some historians have pointed out that a hierarchy existed within the costermonger class and that while costermongers sold from a handcart or animaldrawn cart mere hawkers carried their wares in a basketcostermongers met a need for rapid food distribution from the wholesale markets eg in london smithfield for meat spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or billingsgate for fish by providing retail sales at locations that were convenient for the labouring classes costermongers used a variety of devices to transport and display produce a cart might be stationary at a market stall a mobile horsedrawn or wheelbarrow apparatus or a handheld basket might be used for lightweight goods such as herbs and flowers costermongers experienced a turbulent history yet survived numerous attempts to eradicate their class from the streets programmes designed to curtail their activities occurred during the reigns of elizabeth i charles i and reached a peak during victorian times however the social cohesion within the coster community along with sympathetic public support enabled them to resist efforts to eradicate them as highly visible colourful characters who provided service and convenience to the labouring classes costermongers enjoyed a high level of public sympathy at times when they came under attack from authorities they became known for their melodic sales patter poems and chants which they used to attract attention both the sound and appearance of costermongers contributed to a distinctive street life that characterised london and other large european cities including paris especially in the 18th and 19th centuries their loud singsong cry or chants used to attract attention became part of the fabric of street life in large cities in britain and europe costermongers exhibited a distinct identity individuals signalled membership of the coster community through a dress code especially the large neckerchief known as a kingsman tied round their necks their hostility towards the police was legendary the distinctive identity and culture of costermongers led to considerable appeal as subjectmatter for artists dramatists comedians writers and musicians parodies of the costermonger and his way of life were frequent features in victorian music halls costermongers were ubiquitous in midvictorian england but their numbers began to decline in the second half of the 20th century when they began to take up pitches in the regulated markets	street seller of fruit and vegetables	street seller of fruit and vegetables	City
Street photography	<p><b>Street photography</b>, also sometimes called candid photography, is photography conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public places. Although there is a difference between street and candid photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some candid photography being classifiable as street photography. Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment. Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.</p> <p>The street photographer can be seen as an extension of the <i>flâneur</i>, an observer of the streets (who was often a writer or artist).</p><p>Framing and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment. </p><p>Street photography can focus on people and their behavior in public, thereby also recording people's history. This motivation entails having also to navigate or negotiate changing expectations and laws of privacy, security and property. In this respect the street photographer is similar to social documentary photographers or photojournalists who also work in public places, but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events; any of these photographers' images may capture people and property visible within or from public places. The existence of services like Google Street View, recording public space at a massive scale, and the burgeoning trend of self-photography (selfies), further complicate ethical issues reflected in attitudes to street photography. </p><p>However, street photography does not need to exclusively feature people within the frame. It can also focus on traces left by humanity that say something about life. Photographers such as William Eggleston often produce street photography where there are no people in the frame, but their presence is suggested by the subject matter. </p><p>Much of what is regarded, stylistically and subjectively, as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century through to the late 1970s, a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled candid photography in public places. </p>	street photography also sometimes called candid photography is photography conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public places although there is a difference between street and candid photography it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some candid photography being classifiable as street photography street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment though people usually feature directly street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic the street photographer can be seen as an extension of the flâneur an observer of the streets who was often a writer or artistframing and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment street photography can focus on people and their behavior in public thereby also recording peoples history this motivation entails having also to navigate or negotiate changing expectations and laws of privacy security and property in this respect the street photographer is similar to social documentary photographers or photojournalists who also work in public places but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events any of these photographers images may capture people and property visible within or from public places the existence of services like google street view recording public space at a massive scale and the burgeoning trend of selfphotography selfies further complicate ethical issues reflected in attitudes to street photography however street photography does not need to exclusively feature people within the frame it can also focus on traces left by humanity that say something about life photographers such as william eggleston often produce street photography where there are no people in the frame but their presence is suggested by the subject matter much of what is regarded stylistically and subjectively as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century through to the late 1970s a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled candid photography in public places	photography genre	photography genre	City

Carnival	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Carnival</b> is a Catholic festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus. Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent. Traditionally, butter, milk, and other animal products were not consumed ""excessively"", rather, their stock was fully consumed as to reduce waste. This festival is known for being a time of great indulgence before Lent (which is a time stressing the opposite), with drinking, overeating, and various other activities of indulgence being performed. For example, Pancakes, donuts, and other desserts are prepared and eaten for a final time. During Lent, animal products are eaten less, and individuals have the ability to make a Lenten sacrifice, thus giving up a certain object or activity of desire. </p><p>Other common features of Carnival include mock battles such as food fights; expressions of social satire; mockery of authorities; costumes of the grotesque body that display exaggerated features such as large noses, bellies, mouths, phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms. The Italian tradition of wearing masks dates back to the Venice Carnival in the 15th century, and has been an inspiration in Greek theater and Commedia dell'arte for centuries.</p><p>The term <i>Carnival</i> is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence, as well as in Greece. In historically Evangelical Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans (Church of England/US Episcopal Church), Methodists, and other Protestants, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras. In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.).

Street marketing	<p><b>Street marketing</b> is a form of guerrilla marketing that uses nontraditional or unconventional methods to promote a product or service. Many businesses use fliers, coupons, posters and art displays as a cost-effective alternative to the traditional marketing methods such as television, print and social media. Based on the shifting characteristics of modern-day consumers – such as increased product knowledge and expectations of transparency – the goal of street marketing is to use direct communication to enhance brand recognition.</p><p>This style of marketing grew in popularity in 1986 when Jay Conrad Levinson published his book <i>Guerrilla Marketing</i>, which paved the future for unconventional and abnormal brand campaigns. Street marketing is often confused with ambient marketing, which is a marketing strategy of placing ads on unusual objects or in unusual places where you wouldn't usually expect to have an advertisement. Unlike typical public marketing campaigns that use billboards, street marketing involves the application of multiple techniques and practices in order to establish direct contact with the customers. The goals of this interaction include causing an emotional reaction in potential customers, and getting people to remember brands in a different way.</p>	street marketing is a form of guerrilla marketing that uses nontraditional or unconventional methods to promote a product or service many businesses use fliers coupons posters and art displays as a costeffective alternative to the traditional marketing methods such as television print and social media based on the shifting characteristics of modernday consumers – such as increased product knowledge and expectations of transparency – the goal of street marketing is to use direct communication to enhance brand recognitionthis style of marketing grew in popularity in 1986 when jay conrad levinson published his book guerrilla marketing which paved the future for unconventional and abnormal brand campaigns street marketing is often confused with ambient marketing which is a marketing strategy of placing ads on unusual objects or in unusual places where you wouldnt usually expect to have an advertisement unlike typical public marketing campaigns that use billboards street marketing involves the application of multiple techniques and practices in order to establish direct contact with the customers the goals of this interaction include causing an emotional reaction in potential customers and getting people to remember brands in a different way	Kind of unconventional marketing or promoting	kind of unconventional marketing or promoting	City

Marketplace	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p>A <b>marketplace</b> or <b>market place</b> is a location where people regularly gather for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other goods. In different parts of the world, a marketplace may be described as a <i>souk</i> (from the Arabic), <i>bazaar</i> (from the Persian), a fixed <i>mercado</i> (Spanish), or itinerant <i>tianguis</i> (Mexico), or <i>palengke</i> (Philippines). Some markets operate daily and are said to be <i>permanent</i> markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be <i>periodic markets.</i> The form that a market adopts depends on its locality's population, culture, ambient and geographic conditions. The term <i>market</i> covers many types of trading, as market squares, market halls and food halls, and their different varieties. Thus marketplaces can be both outdoors and indoors, and in the modern world, online marketplaces. </p><p>Markets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar. Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun. In Europe, informal, unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal, chartered markets from the 12th century. Throughout the medieval period, increased regulation of marketplace practices, especially weights and measures, gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices. Around the globe, markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions, especially weather, tradition, and culture. In the Middle East, markets tend to be covered, to protect traders and shoppers from the sun. In milder climates, markets are often open air. In Asia, a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in non-perishables is common. </p><p>Today, markets can also be accessed electronically or on the internet through e-commerce or matching platforms. In many countries, shopping at a local market is a standard feature of daily life. Given the market's role in ensuring food supply for a population, markets are often highly regulated by a central authority. In many places, designated market places have become listed sites of historic and architectural significance and represent part of a town's or nation's cultural assets. For these reasons, they are often popular tourist destinations. </p>"	a marketplace or market place is a location where people regularly gather for the purchase and sale of provisions livestock and other goods in different parts of the world a marketplace may be described as a souk from the arabic bazaar from the persian a fixed mercado spanish or itinerant tianguis mexico or palengke philippines some markets operate daily and are said to be permanent markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be periodic markets the form that a market adopts depends on its localitys population culture ambient and geographic conditions the term market covers many types of trading as market squares market halls and food halls and their different varieties thus marketplaces can be both outdoors and indoors and in the modern world online marketplaces markets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade the earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in persia from where they spread to the rest of the middle east and europe documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3000 bce creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar middle eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun in europe informal unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal chartered markets from the 12th century throughout the medieval period increased regulation of marketplace practices especially weights and measures gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices around the globe markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions especially weather tradition and culture in the middle east markets tend to be covered to protect traders and shoppers from the sun in milder climates markets are often open air in asia a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in nonperishables is common today markets can also be accessed electronically or on the internet through ecommerce or matching platforms in many countries shopping at a local market is a standard feature of daily life given the markets role in ensuring food supply for a population markets are often highly regulated by a central authority in many places designated market places have become listed sites of historic and architectural significance and represent part of a towns or nations cultural assets for these reasons they are often popular tourist destinations	space in which a market operates	space in which a market operates	City

In several passages of his work, Mayhew categorises hawkers, hucksters, and peddlers as a single group of itinerant salesman, and claims that he is unable to say what distinction was drawn between a hawker and a huckster.

In London more specific terms were used, such as costermonger. </p><p>From antiquity, peddlers filled the gaps in the formal market economy by providing consumers with the convenience of door-to-door service. They operated alongside town markets and fairs where they often purchased surplus stocks which were subsequently resold to consumers. Peddlers were able to distribute goods to the more geographically isolated communities such as those who lived in mountainous regions of Europe. They also called on consumers who, for whatever reason, found it difficult to attend town markets. Thus, peddlers played an important role in linking these consumers and regions to wider trade routes. Some peddlers worked as agents or travelling salesmen for larger manufacturers, thus were the precursor to the modern travelling salesman. </p><p>Images of peddlers feature in literature and art from as early as the 12th-century. Such images were very popular with the genre and Orientalist painters and photographers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Some imagery depicts peddlers in a pejorative manner, while others portray idealised, Romantic visions of peddlers at work. </p>	a peddler in british english pedlar also known as a chapman packman cheapjack hawker higler huckster costermonger colporteur or solicitor is a doortodoor andor travelling vendor of goods in england the term was mostly used for travellers hawking goods in the countryside to small towns and villages in london more specific terms were used such as costermonger from antiquity peddlers filled the gaps in the formal market economy by providing consumers with the convenience of doortodoor service they operated alongside town markets and fairs where they often purchased surplus stocks which were subsequently resold to consumers peddlers were able to distribute goods to the more geographically isolated communities such as those who lived in mountainous regions of europe they also called on consumers who for whatever reason found it difficult to attend town markets thus peddlers played an important role in linking these consumers and regions to wider trade routes some peddlers worked as agents or travelling salesmen for larger manufacturers thus were the precursor to the modern travelling salesman images of peddlers feature in literature and art from as early as the 12thcentury such images were very popular with the genre and orientalist painters and photographers of the 18th and 19th centuries some imagery depicts peddlers in a pejorative manner while others portray idealised romantic visions of peddlers at work	travelling vendor of goods	travelling vendor of goods	City

Road cycling	<p><b>Road cycling</b> is the most widespread form of cycling in which cyclists ride on paved roadways. It includes recreational, racing, commuting, and utility cycling. As users of the road, road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same laws as motorists, however there are certain exceptions. While there are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads such as BMX, recumbents, racing, touring and utility bicycles, dedicated road bicycles have specific characteristics that make them ideal for the sport. Road bicycles have thinner tires, lighter frames with no suspension, and a set of drop handle bars to allow riders to get in a more aerodynamic position while cycling at higher speeds. On a flat road, an intermediate cyclist can average about 18 to 20 mph (29 to 32 km/h), while a professional rider can average up to 25 mph (40 km/h). At higher speeds, wind resistance gets stronger and the light, aerodynamic road bikes that have developed over the years ensure that most of the riders' energy is spent propelling the bike forward.</p>	road cycling is the most widespread form of cycling in which cyclists ride on paved roadways it includes recreational racing commuting and utility cycling as users of the road road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same laws as motorists however there are certain exceptions while there are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads such as bmx recumbents racing touring and utility bicycles dedicated road bicycles have specific characteristics that make them ideal for the sport road bicycles have thinner tires lighter frames with no suspension and a set of drop handle bars to allow riders to get in a more aerodynamic position while cycling at higher speeds on a flat road an intermediate cyclist can average about 18 to 20 mph 29 to 32 kmh while a professional rider can average up to 25 mph 40 kmh at higher speeds wind resistance gets stronger and the light aerodynamic road bikes that have developed over the years ensure that most of the riders energy is spent propelling the bike forward	form of cycling including recreational, racing, and utility cycling	form of cycling including recreational racing and utility cycling	City

Road skating	<p><b>Road skating</b> is the sport of skating (inline skating or quad roller skating) on roads, much like road cycling. It shares much with inline speed skating. </p><p>Roadskaters often skate in tight packs, drafting each other and sharing the lead, which allows a pack to travel faster than an individual skater. The individual members of a pack use comparatively less energy than the lone skater traveling at the same speed. Even the lead skater in the pack enjoys an advantage from the drafting skaters behind. </p><p>While gliding downhill, an inline skater in a tucked position can achieve speeds that exceed the speed of a tucked cyclist. This is due to lower wind resistance. The rolling resistance is similar for a cyclist and a skater — it is only when actively skating (i.e., in the skating stroke) that the skater incurs greater resistance. Skating is roughly 50% slower than cycling on flat ground. </p><p>Skaters routinely achieve downhill speeds of 60 km/h (37 mph), similar to cyclists. Compared to cyclists, though, skaters particularly suffer on uphills, when the drafting advantage disappears. </p><p>A skating paceline going down hills may easily achieve speeds faster than a cycling paceline of equal length. The reason is that the road skating paceline has a much more efficient draft effect. The draft effect in road skating is superior for three reasons: </p> <ol><li>each skater can be much closer to the person in front of her, whereas each cyclist is limited by the distance of the wheels;</li> <li>each skater gaining inertia energy from being in the draft can translate this energy to the person in front of her by maintaining contact (usually by placing a hand on the lower back of the person in front); and</li> <li>the skater has much less equipment-related aerodynamic drag than the cyclist.</li></ol>	road skating is the sport of skating inline skating or quad roller skating on roads much like road cycling it shares much with inline speed skating roadskaters often skate in tight packs drafting each other and sharing the lead which allows a pack to travel faster than an individual skater the individual members of a pack use comparatively less energy than the lone skater traveling at the same speed even the lead skater in the pack enjoys an advantage from the drafting skaters behind while gliding downhill an inline skater in a tucked position can achieve speeds that exceed the speed of a tucked cyclist this is due to lower wind resistance the rolling resistance is similar for a cyclist and a skater — it is only when actively skating ie in the skating stroke that the skater incurs greater resistance skating is roughly 50 slower than cycling on flat ground skaters routinely achieve downhill speeds of 60 kmh 37 mph similar to cyclists compared to cyclists though skaters particularly suffer on uphills when the drafting advantage disappears a skating paceline going down hills may easily achieve speeds faster than a cycling paceline of equal length the reason is that the road skating paceline has a much more efficient draft effect the draft effect in road skating is superior for three reasons each skater can be much closer to the person in front of her whereas each cyclist is limited by the distance of the wheels each skater gaining inertia energy from being in the draft can translate this energy to the person in front of her by maintaining contact usually by placing a hand on the lower back of the person in front and the skater has much less equipmentrelated aerodynamic drag than the cyclist	sport discipline	sport discipline	City

AVANT	<p><b>AVANT</b>, also known as <b>AVANT street art guerrilla collective,</b> was the artist group active in New York City from 1980 to 1984. By 1984 AVANT had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops and galleries citywide. Principal artists were Christopher Hart Chambers, David Fried, and Marc Thorne. </p><p>AVANT was a group of five young New York artists working collectively who wheat pasted handmade original poster sized works of non-calligraphic art in the streets of NYC. While the members of Avant assert that they began in the winter of 1980, the earliest available press documentation of their street art or art exhibitions is found in the New York Native from June 1982, wherein a later article published in the Villager places their origins at January 1981. By 1984 avant had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops, galleries and museums citywide, concentrated mostly in lower Manhattan. As a group, they were capable of producing hundreds of individual paintings per week, and deployed them in the streets on a regular basis. They also mounted three-dimensional artworks to street sign poles and commandeered bus stop advertising light boxes, replacing the contents with their own original works of art, then relocking the cabinets. Over 40 exhibitions of AVANT's work were held in New York galleries and nightclubs between 1981 and 1984.

Siege of Carthage (Third Punic War)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Siege of Carthage</b> was the main engagement of the Third Punic War fought between Carthage and Rome. It consisted of the nearly-three-year siege of the Carthaginian capital, Carthage (a little north east of Tunis). In 149 BC a large Roman army landed at Utica in North Africa. The Carthaginians hoped to appease the Romans, but despite the Carthaginians surrendering all of their weapons, the Romans pressed on to besiege the city of Carthage. The Roman campaign suffered repeated setbacks through 149 BC, only alleviated by Scipio Aemilianus, a middle-ranking officer, distinguishing himself several times. A new Roman commander took over in 148 BC, and fared equally badly. At the annual election of Roman magistrates in early 147 BC the public support for Scipio was so great that the usual age restrictions were lifted to allow him to be appointed commander in Africa. </p><p>Scipio's term commenced with two Carthaginian successes, but he tightened the siege and commenced a construction of a large mole to prevent supplies from getting into Carthage via blockade runners. The Carthaginians had partially rebuilt their fleet and it sortied, to the Romans' surprise; after an indecisive engagement the Carthaginians mismanaged their withdrawal and lost many ships. The Romans then built a large brick structure in the harbour area which dominated the city wall. In the spring of 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault and over seven days systematically destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants; only on the last day did they take prisoners – 50,000, who were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian territories became the Roman province of Africa with Utica as its capital.

It lasted from August 13, 1937, to November 26, 1937, and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war, later described as ""Stalingrad on the Yangtze"", and is often regarded as the battle where World War II started. After over three months of extensive fighting on land, in the air and at sea, the battle concluded with a victory for Japan. </p><p>Since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 followed by the Japanese attack of Shanghai in 1932, there had been ongoing armed conflicts between China and Japan without an official declaration of war. These conflicts finally escalated in July 1937, when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the full advance from Japan. Dogged Chinese resistance at Shanghai was aimed at stalling Japanese advance, giving much needed time for the Chinese government to move vital industries to the interior, while at the same time attempting to bring sympathetic Western powers to China's side. During the fierce three-month battle, Chinese and Japanese troops fought in downtown Shanghai, in the outlying towns, and on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay, where the Japanese had made amphibious landings. </p><p>Chinese forces were equipped with primarily with small-caliber weapons against much greater Japanese air, naval, and armor power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, while failing to elicit any international intervention. The resistance of Chinese forces and length of the battle at over 3 months shocked the Japanese, who had been indoctrinated with notions of cultural and martial superiority, and largely demoralized the Imperial Japanese Army who believed they could take Shanghai within days and China within months. </p><p>The battle can be divided into three stages, and eventually involved nearly one million troops. The first stage lasted from August 13 to August 22, 1937, during which the NRA attempted to eradicate Japanese troop presence in downtown Shanghai. The second stage lasted from August 23 to October 26, 1937, during which the Japanese launched amphibious landings on the Jiangsu coast and the two armies fought a Stalingrad-type house-to-house battle, with the Japanese attempting to gain control of the city and the surrounding regions. The last stage, ranging from October 27 to the end of November 1937, involved the retreat of the Chinese army in the face of Japanese flanking maneuvers, and the ensuing combat on the road to China's capital, Nanjing. </p>"	the battle of shanghai chinese 淞滬會戰 was the first of the twentytwo major engagements fought between the national revolutionary army nra of the republic of china roc and the imperial japanese army ija of the empire of japan at the beginning of the second sinojapanese war it lasted from august 13 1937 to november 26 1937 and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war later described as stalingrad on the yangtze and is often regarded as the battle where world war ii started after over three months of extensive fighting on land in the air and at sea the battle concluded with a victory for japan since the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 followed by the japanese attack of shanghai in 1932 there had been ongoing armed conflicts between china and japan without an official declaration of war these conflicts finally escalated in july 1937 when the marco polo bridge incident triggered the full advance from japan dogged chinese resistance at shanghai was aimed at stalling japanese advance giving much needed time for the chinese government to move vital industries to the interior while at the same time attempting to bring sympathetic western powers to chinas side during the fierce threemonth battle chinese and japanese troops fought in downtown shanghai in the outlying towns and on the beaches of the yangtze river and hangzhou bay where the japanese had made amphibious landings chinese forces were equipped with primarily with smallcaliber weapons against much greater japanese air naval and armor power in the end shanghai fell and china lost a significant portion of its best troops while failing to elicit any international intervention the resistance of chinese forces and length of the battle at over 3 months shocked the japanese who had been indoctrinated with notions of cultural and martial superiority and largely demoralized the imperial japanese army who believed they could take shanghai within days and china within months the battle can be divided into three stages and eventually involved nearly one million troops the first stage lasted from august 13 to august 22 1937 during which the nra attempted to eradicate japanese troop presence in downtown shanghai the second stage lasted from august 23 to october 26 1937 during which the japanese launched amphibious landings on the jiangsu coast and the two armies fought a stalingradtype housetohouse battle with the japanese attempting to gain control of the city and the surrounding regions the last stage ranging from october 27 to the end of november 1937 involved the retreat of the chinese army in the face of japanese flanking maneuvers and the ensuing combat on the road to chinas capital nanjing	1937 battle of the Second Sino-Japanese War	1937 battle of the second sinojapanese war	City

Initially anarchic, during the Hungarian Uprising the Hungarian people culminated in protests against domestic policies imposed by the USSR, and the people formed together in protest against the Soviet Union.</p><p>The Hungarian Revolution began on 23 October 1956 in Budapest when university students appealed to the civil populace to join them at the Hungarian Parliament Building to protest against the USSR's geopolitical domination of Hungary with the Stalinist government of Mátyás Rákosi. A delegation of students entered the building of Hungarian Radio to broadcast their sixteen demands for political and economic reforms to the civil society of Hungary, but they were instead detained by security guards. When the student protestors outside the radio building demanded the release of their delegation of students, policemen from the ÁVH (Államvédelmi Hatóság) state protection authority shot and killed several protestors.</p><p>Consequently, Hungarians organized into revolutionary militias to fight against the ÁVH; local Hungarian Communist leaders and ÁVH policemen were captured and summarily killed or lynched; and anti-communist political prisoners were released and armed.

Urban warfare	"<p><b>Urban warfare</b> is combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities. Urban combat differs from combat in the open at both the operational and the tactical levels. Complicating factors in urban warfare include the presence of civilians and the complexity of the urban terrain. Urban combat operations may be conducted to capitalize on strategic or tactical advantages associated with the possession or the control of a particular urban area or to deny these advantages to the enemy.</p><p>Fighting in urban areas negates the advantages that one side may have over the other in armor, heavy artillery, or air support. Ambushes laid down by small groups of soldiers with handheld anti-tank weapons can destroy entire columns of modern armor (as in the First Battle of Grozny), while artillery and air support can be severely reduced if the ""superior"" party wants to limit civilian casualties as much as possible, but the defending party does not (or even uses civilians as human shields). </p><p>Some civilians may be difficult to distinguish from such combatants as armed militias and gangs, and particularly individuals who are simply trying to protect their homes from attackers. Tactics are complicated by a three-dimensional environment, limited fields of view and fire because of buildings, enhanced concealment and cover for defenders, below-ground infrastructure, and the ease of placement of booby traps and snipers.</p>"	urban warfare is combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities urban combat differs from combat in the open at both the operational and the tactical levels complicating factors in urban warfare include the presence of civilians and the complexity of the urban terrain urban combat operations may be conducted to capitalize on strategic or tactical advantages associated with the possession or the control of a particular urban area or to deny these advantages to the enemyfighting in urban areas negates the advantages that one side may have over the other in armor heavy artillery or air support ambushes laid down by small groups of soldiers with handheld antitank weapons can destroy entire columns of modern armor as in the first battle of grozny while artillery and air support can be severely reduced if the superior party wants to limit civilian casualties as much as possible but the defending party does not or even uses civilians as human shields some civilians may be difficult to distinguish from such combatants as armed militias and gangs and particularly individuals who are simply trying to protect their homes from attackers tactics are complicated by a threedimensional environment limited fields of view and fire because of buildings enhanced concealment and cover for defenders belowground infrastructure and the ease of placement of booby traps and snipers	combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities	combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities	City
1969 Northern Ireland riots	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>During 12–16 August 1969, there was an outbreak of political and sectarian violence throughout Northern Ireland, which is often seen as the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles. There had been sporadic violence throughout the year arising out of the Northern Ireland civil rights campaign, which demanded an end to discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists. Civil rights marches had been attacked by Protestant loyalists, and protesters often clashed with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), the overwhelmingly Protestant police force. </p><p>On 12 August, the Battle of the Bogside erupted in Derry: three days of fierce clashes between the RUC and thousands of Catholic/nationalist residents of the Bogside district. The besieged residents built barricades and set up first aid posts and workshops for making petrol bombs. Police fired CS gas at rioters for the first time in the history of the UK. In support of the Bogsiders, on 13 August Catholics/nationalists held protests elsewhere in Northern Ireland, some of which led to violence. The bloodiest clashes were in Belfast, where seven people were killed and hundreds wounded, five of them Catholic civilians shot by police. Protesters clashed with both the police and with loyalists, who attacked Catholic districts. Scores of homes and businesses were burnt out, most of them owned by Catholics, and thousands of mostly Catholic families were driven from their homes. In some cases, police helped the loyalists and failed to protect Catholic areas. Some viewed this as an attempted pogrom against the Catholic minority. Both republican and loyalist paramilitaries were involved in the clashes. There were also clashes between protesters and police in Armagh, where a protester was killed by police, as well as in Dungannon and Newry. </p><p>The British Army was deployed to restore order on 14 August, beginning the thirty-seven year Operation Banner, and peace lines were built to separate Catholic and Protestant districts. The Republic of Ireland's government set up field hospitals and refugee centres near the Irish border, and called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be sent to Northern Ireland. The British government held an inquiry into the riots, and the reserve police force was disbanded. The riots led to the formation of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Official Irish Republican Army. It also led to the growth of loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). </p>"	during 12–16 august 1969 there was an outbreak of political and sectarian violence throughout northern ireland which is often seen as the beginning of the thirtyyear conflict known as the troubles there had been sporadic violence throughout the year arising out of the northern ireland civil rights campaign which demanded an end to discrimination against catholics and irish nationalists civil rights marches had been attacked by protestant loyalists and protesters often clashed with the royal ulster constabulary ruc the overwhelmingly protestant police force on 12 august the battle of the bogside erupted in derry three days of fierce clashes between the ruc and thousands of catholicnationalist residents of the bogside district the besieged residents built barricades and set up first aid posts and workshops for making petrol bombs police fired cs gas at rioters for the first time in the history of the uk in support of the bogsiders on 13 august catholicsnationalists held protests elsewhere in northern ireland some of which led to violence the bloodiest clashes were in belfast where seven people were killed and hundreds wounded five of them catholic civilians shot by police protesters clashed with both the police and with loyalists who attacked catholic districts scores of homes and businesses were burnt out most of them owned by catholics and thousands of mostly catholic families were driven from their homes in some cases police helped the loyalists and failed to protect catholic areas some viewed this as an attempted pogrom against the catholic minority both republican and loyalist paramilitaries were involved in the clashes there were also clashes between protesters and police in armagh where a protester was killed by police as well as in dungannon and newry the british army was deployed to restore order on 14 august beginning the thirtyseven year operation banner and peace lines were built to separate catholic and protestant districts the republic of irelands government set up field hospitals and refugee centres near the irish border and called for a united nations peacekeeping force to be sent to northern ireland the british government held an inquiry into the riots and the reserve police force was disbanded the riots led to the formation of the provisional irish republican army and the official irish republican army it also led to the growth of loyalist paramilitaries such as the ulster volunteer force uvf	series of political and sectarian riots, August 1969	series of political and sectarian riots august 1969	City

Gwangju Uprising	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Gwangju Uprising</b> was a popular uprising in the city of Gwangju, South Korea, from May 18 to May 27, 1980, which pitted local, armed citizens against soldiers and police of the South Korean government.

Some Gwangju citizens took up arms, raiding local police stations and armouries, and were able to take control of large sections of the city before soldiers re-entered the city and put down the uprising. At the time, the South Korean government reported estimates of around 170 people killed, but other estimates have measured 600 to 2,300 people killed. During Chun Doo-hwan's unelected presidency, the authorities defined the incident by classifying it as the ''Gwangju Riot,'' and claimed that it was being instigated by ""communist sympathizers and rioters"", possibly acting on support of the North Korean government.</p><p>Denial of or support for the Gwangju Uprising has long acted as a litmus test between conservative and far-right groups and beliefs, and mainstream and progressive sectors of the population, within modern Korean politics. The far-right groups have sought to discredit the uprising. One such argument points to the fact that it occurred before Chun Doo-hwan officially took office, and so contend that it could not really have been a simple student protest against him that started it. However, Chun Doo-hwan had become the de facto leader of South Korea at that time since coming into power on December 12, 1979, after leading a successful military coup against the previous South Korean government which was itself also authoritarian.</p><p>In 1997, a national cemetery and day of commemoration (May 18), along with acts to ""compensate, and restore honor"" to victims, were established.

First Red Scare	<p>The <b>First Red Scare</b> was a period during the early 20th-century history of the United States marked by a widespread fear of far-left extremism, including but not limited to Bolshevism and anarchism, due to real and imagined events; real events included the Russian 1917 October Revolution and anarchist bombings. At its height in 1919–1920, concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in American society and the alleged spread of communism and anarchism in the American labor movement fueled a general sense of concern. </p><p>The Scare had its origins in the hyper-nationalism of World War I as well as the Russian Revolution. At the war's end, following the October Revolution, American authorities saw the threat of communist revolution in the actions of organized labor, including such disparate cases as the Seattle General Strike and the Boston Police Strike and then in the bombing campaign directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders. Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings, and then spurred on by the Palmer Raids and attempts by United States Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to suppress radical organizations, it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric, illegal search and seizures, unwarranted arrests and detentions, and the deportation of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists. In addition, the growing anti-immigration nativist movement among Americans viewed increasing immigration from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe as a threat to American political and social stability. </p><p>Bolshevism and the threat of a communist-inspired revolution in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the social order, even for such largely unrelated events as incidents of interracial violence during the Red Summer of 1919. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in the form of display of certain flags and banners. In April 1920, concerns peaked with J. Edgar Hoover telling the nation to prepare for a bloody uprising on May Day. Police and militias prepared for the worst, but May Day passed without incident. Soon, public opinion and the courts turned against Palmer, putting an end to his raids and the First Red Scare. </p>	the first red scare was a period during the early 20thcentury history of the united states marked by a widespread fear of farleft extremism including but not limited to bolshevism and anarchism due to real and imagined events real events included the russian 1917 october revolution and anarchist bombings at its height in 1919–1920 concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in american society and the alleged spread of communism and anarchism in the american labor movement fueled a general sense of concern the scare had its origins in the hypernationalism of world war i as well as the russian revolution at the wars end following the october revolution american authorities saw the threat of communist revolution in the actions of organized labor including such disparate cases as the seattle general strike and the boston police strike and then in the bombing campaign directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings and then spurred on by the palmer raids and attempts by united states attorney general a mitchell palmer to suppress radical organizations it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric illegal search and seizures unwarranted arrests and detentions and the deportation of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists in addition the growing antiimmigration nativist movement among americans viewed increasing immigration from southern europe and eastern europe as a threat to american political and social stability bolshevism and the threat of a communistinspired revolution in the us became the overriding explanation for challenges to the social order even for such largely unrelated events as incidents of interracial violence during the red summer of 1919 fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in the form of display of certain flags and banners in april 1920 concerns peaked with j edgar hoover telling the nation to prepare for a bloody uprising on may day police and militias prepared for the worst but may day passed without incident soon public opinion and the courts turned against palmer putting an end to his raids and the first red scare	early 20th-century American historical event	early 20thcentury american historical event	City

Prague uprising	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Prague uprising</b> (Czech: <i lang=""cs"">Pražské povstání</i>) was a partially successful attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation in May 1945, at the end of World War II. The preceding six years of occupation had fuelled anti-German sentiment and the approach of the Soviet Red Army and the US Third Army offered a chance of success. </p><p>On 5 May 1945, in the last moments of the war in Europe, Czech citizens spontaneously attacked the German occupiers and Czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join the uprising. The Russian Liberation Army, which had been fighting for the Germans, defected and supported the Czechs. German troops counter-attacked, but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by the Czech citizenry. On 8 May, the Czech and German leaders signed a ceasefire allowing the German forces to withdraw from the city, but not all Waffen-SS units obeyed. Fighting continued until 9 May, when the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city. </p><p>The uprising was brutal, with both sides committing war crimes. The German side used Czech civilians as human shields and committed massacres. Violence against German civilians, sanctioned by the Czechoslovak government, continued after the liberation, and was justified as revenge for the occupation or as a means to encourage Germans to flee. George Patton’s US Third Army was ordered by General Dwight Eisenhower not to come to the aid of the Czech insurgents, which undermined the credibility of the Western powers in postwar Czechoslovakia. Instead, the uprising was presented as a symbol of Czech resistance to Nazi rule, and the liberation by the Red Army was used by the Czechoslovak Communist Party to increase popular support for the party. </p>"	the prague uprising czech pražské povstání was a partially successful attempt by the czech resistance to liberate the city of prague from german occupation in may 1945 at the end of world war ii the preceding six years of occupation had fuelled antigerman sentiment and the approach of the soviet red army and the us third army offered a chance of success on 5 may 1945 in the last moments of the war in europe czech citizens spontaneously attacked the german occupiers and czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join the uprising the russian liberation army which had been fighting for the germans defected and supported the czechs german troops counterattacked but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by the czech citizenry on 8 may the czech and german leaders signed a ceasefire allowing the german forces to withdraw from the city but not all waffenss units obeyed fighting continued until 9 may when the red army entered the nearly liberated city the uprising was brutal with both sides committing war crimes the german side used czech civilians as human shields and committed massacres violence against german civilians sanctioned by the czechoslovak government continued after the liberation and was justified as revenge for the occupation or as a means to encourage germans to flee george patton ’ s us third army was ordered by general dwight eisenhower not to come to the aid of the czech insurgents which undermined the credibility of the western powers in postwar czechoslovakia instead the uprising was presented as a symbol of czech resistance to nazi rule and the liberation by the red army was used by the czechoslovak communist party to increase popular support for the party	uprising attempting to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation during World War II	uprising attempting to liberate the city of prague from german occupation during world war ii	City
Battle of Helsinki	<p>The <b>Battle of Helsinki</b> was a 1918 Finnish Civil War battle, fought in 12–13 April between the German troops and Finnish Whites against the Finnish Reds in Helsinki, Finland. Together with the battles of Tampere and Vyborg, it was one of the three major urban battles of the Finnish Civil War. The Germans invaded Helsinki despite the opposition of Finnish White Army leader Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim who wanted to attack the capital city with his own troops after Tampere had fallen on 6 April. However, the Germans had their own interest in taking Helsinki as quickly as possible and then moving further east towards the Russian border. The city had been under Red control for 11 weeks since the beginning of the war. </p><p>The German Baltic Sea Division landed in Finland on 3 April and entered the Helsinki area eight days later. In the city centre, the defending Reds did not have defensive lines or barricades but were fighting inside single buildings and blocks, which the Germans then had to take one by one. During the battle, life in Helsinki went on as usual. The shops and restaurants were open, the public transportation functioned and factories were running. Curious spectators were wandering so close that the Germans had to tell them to move back. The White supporters considered the Germans liberators and handed them flowers as well as tea, coffee and snacks to eat. </p><p>Nearly 500 people were killed in the battle. The number includes about 400 Red Guard fighters who were killed in action or executed after capitulation, 54 Germans and 23 White Guard members.

Battle of Stalingrad	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Battle of Stalingrad</b> (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943) was a major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II where Nazi Germany and its allies unsuccessfully fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (later renamed to Volgograd) in Southern Russia. The battle was marked by fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, with the battle being the epitome of urban warfare. The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle to take place during the Second World War and is one of the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare, with an estimated 2 million total casualties. Today, the Battle of Stalingrad is universally regarded as the turning point in the European Theatre of war, as it forced the <i>Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</i> (German High Command) to withdraw considerable military forces from other areas in occupied Europe to replace German losses on the Eastern Front. The victory at Stalingrad energized the Red Army and shifted the balance of power in the favour of the Soviets. </p><p>Stalingrad was strategically important to both sides as a major industrial and transport hub on the Volga River. Whoever controlled Stalingrad would have access to the oil fields of the Caucasus; and control of the Volga. Germany, already operating on dwindling fuel supplies focused its efforts on moving deeper into Soviet territory and taking the oil fields at any cost. On 4 August, the Germans launched an offensive by using the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intense <i>Luftwaffe</i> bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The battle degenerated into house-to-house fighting as both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November, the Germans, at great cost, had pushed the Soviet defenders back into narrow zones along the west bank of the river. </p><p>On 19 November, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian armies protecting the 6th Army's flanks. The Axis flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area. Adolf Hitler was determined to hold the city at all costs and forbade the 6th Army from attempting a breakout; instead, attempts were made to supply it by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. The Soviets were successful in denying the Germans the ability to resupply through the air which strained the German forces to their breaking point. Nevertheless the German forces were determined to continue their advance and heavy fighting continued for another two months. On 2 February 1943, the German 6th army, having exhausted their ammunition and food, finally capitulated, making it the first of Hitler's field armies to surrender during World War II, after five months, one week, and three days of fighting. </p>"	the battle of stalingrad 23 august 1942 – 2 february 1943 was a major battle on the eastern front of world war ii where nazi germany and its allies unsuccessfully fought the soviet union for control of the city of stalingrad later renamed to volgograd in southern russia the battle was marked by fierce closequarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids with the battle being the epitome of urban warfare the battle of stalingrad was the deadliest battle to take place during the second world war and is one of the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare with an estimated 2 million total casualties today the battle of stalingrad is universally regarded as the turning point in the european theatre of war as it forced the oberkommando der wehrmacht german high command to withdraw considerable military forces from other areas in occupied europe to replace german losses on the eastern front the victory at stalingrad energized the red army and shifted the balance of power in the favour of the soviets stalingrad was strategically important to both sides as a major industrial and transport hub on the volga river whoever controlled stalingrad would have access to the oil fields of the caucasus and control of the volga germany already operating on dwindling fuel supplies focused its efforts on moving deeper into soviet territory and taking the oil fields at any cost on 4 august the germans launched an offensive by using the 6th army and elements of the 4th panzer army the attack was supported by intense luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble the battle degenerated into housetohouse fighting as both sides poured reinforcements into the city by midnovember the germans at great cost had pushed the soviet defenders back into narrow zones along the west bank of the river on 19 november the red army launched operation uranus a twopronged attack targeting the weaker romanian armies protecting the 6th armys flanks the axis flanks were overrun and the 6th army was cut off and surrounded in the stalingrad area adolf hitler was determined to hold the city at all costs and forbade the 6th army from attempting a breakout instead attempts were made to supply it by air and to break the encirclement from the outside the soviets were successful in denying the germans the ability to resupply through the air which strained the german forces to their breaking point nevertheless the german forces were determined to continue their advance and heavy fighting continued for another two months on 2 february 1943 the german 6th army having exhausted their ammunition and food finally capitulated making it the first of hitlers field armies to surrender during world war ii after five months one week and three days of fighting	major battle of World War II	major battle of world war ii	City

Quinn was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm as a comic relief henchwoman for the supervillain Joker in <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, and debuted in its 22nd episode, ""Joker's Favor"", on September 11, 1992. While originally intended to appear in one episode, Quinn became a recurring character within the DC Animated Universe as the Joker's sidekick and love interest, and was adapted into DC Comics' Batman comic book canon seven years later, beginning with the one-shot <i>Batman: Harley Quinn</i> #1 (October 1999). Quinn's origin story features her as a former psychiatrist at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum named <b>Dr. Harleen Quinzel</b> who fell in love with the Joker, her patient, eventually becoming his accomplice and lover. The character's alias is a play on the stock character Harlequin from the 16th-century theater <span title=""Italian-language text""><i lang=""it"">commedia dell'arte</i></span>. </p><p>Following her introduction to the DC Universe in 1999, Harley Quinn was depicted as a frequent accomplice and lover of the Joker as well as the best friend of fellow supervillain Poison Ivy. Later stories depicted Quinn as a supervillain who has left her abusive and codependent relationship with the Joker behind, beginning with the publication of her first ongoing series written by Karl Kesel in 2000. After years of scarce appearances in comics, Quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the <i>Gotham City Sirens</i> series, as part of an unstable alliance with Poison Ivy and Catwoman. In 2011, DC's line-wide reboot <i>The New 52</i> reintroduced Quinn in the relaunched <i>Suicide Squad</i> title, which changed the character's personality, design, and origin, replacing her original jester costume with a revealing ensemble and depicting her to be darker than her earlier counterpart. The character took a lighthearted and humorous direction with her second ongoing series in 2013, written by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti, which features the character moving to her hometown of Brooklyn and starting her own life in Coney Island. The character has since been depicted as an antihero independent of the Joker and a recurring core member of the Suicide Squad, with Poison Ivy becoming her primary romantic interest. In 2021, DC's line-wide <i>Infinite Frontier</i> relaunch brought Quinn back to Gotham City and reestablished her as a superhero seeking redemption for her past actions, with a new design combining her early and modern appearances. </p><p>Harley Quinn's abilities include expert gymnastic skills, proficiency in weapons and hand-to-hand combat, complete unpredictability, immunity to toxins, and enhanced strength, agility, and durability.

The character was originally created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero Batman. The character's first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in <i>Detective Comics</i> #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles. Robin's early adventures included <i>Star Spangled Comics</i> #65–130 (1947–1952), the character's first solo feature. He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s, until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing. As a team, Batman and Robin have commonly been referred to as the <i>Caped Crusaders</i> and the <i>Dynamic Duo</i>.</p><p>The character's second incarnation, Jason Todd, first appeared in <i>Batman</i> #357 (1983). He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books until 1988, when he was murdered by the Joker in the storyline ""A Death in the Family"" (1989). Jason later found himself alive after a reality-changing incident, eventually becoming the Red Hood. The premiere <i>Robin</i> limited series was published in 1991, featuring the character's third incarnation, Tim Drake, training to earn the role of Batman's vigilante partner. After two successful sequels, the monthly <i>Robin</i> series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right. In 2004 storylines, established DC Comics character Stephanie Brown became the fourth Robin for a short time before the role reverted to Tim Drake. Damian Wayne succeeds Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc ""Battle for the Cowl."" </p><p>The current and former Robins always feature prominently in Batman's cast of supporting heroes; Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian all regard him as a father. In current continuity as of 2021, Dick Grayson serves as Nightwing, Jason Todd is the Red Hood, Stephanie Brown is Batgirl, and Tim Drake has picked up the mantle of Robin again after a stint as Red Robin. Damian has left behind the title Robin, but remains the title character of the <i>Robin</i> comic book. In recent years, Batman has also adopted new sidekicks in the form of Bluebird, whose name references Robin, and The Signal. </p>"	robin is the alias of several fictional superheroes appearing in american comic books published by dc comics the character was originally created by bob kane bill finger and jerry robinson to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero batman the characters first incarnation dick grayson debuted in detective comics 38 april 1940 conceived as a way to attract young readership robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception doubling the sales of the batman titles robins early adventures included star spangled comics 65–130 1947–1952 the characters first solo feature he made regular appearances in batmanrelated comic books and other dc comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s until the character set aside the robin identity and became the independent superhero nightwing as a team batman and robin have commonly been referred to as the caped crusaders and the dynamic duothe characters second incarnation jason todd first appeared in batman 357 1983 he made regular appearances in batmanrelated comic books until 1988 when he was murdered by the joker in the storyline a death in the family 1989 jason later found himself alive after a realitychanging incident eventually becoming the red hood the premiere robin limited series was published in 1991 featuring the characters third incarnation tim drake training to earn the role of batmans vigilante partner after two successful sequels the monthly robin series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009 which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right in 2004 storylines established dc comics character stephanie brown became the fourth robin for a short time before the role reverted to tim drake damian wayne succeeds drake as robin in the 2009 story arc battle for the cowl the current and former robins always feature prominently in batmans cast of supporting heroes dick jason tim and damian all regard him as a father in current continuity as of 2021 dick grayson serves as nightwing jason todd is the red hood stephanie brown is batgirl and tim drake has picked up the mantle of robin again after a stint as red robin damian has left behind the title robin but remains the title character of the robin comic book in recent years batman has also adopted new sidekicks in the form of bluebird whose name references robin and the signal	several DC Comics characters	several dc comics characters	Comics_characters

Etta Candy	"<p><b>Etta Candy</b> is a fictional character appearing in DC Comics publications and related media, commonly as the best friend of the superhero Wonder Woman. Spirited and vivacious, with a devil-may-care attitude, the first version of Etta appeared as a young white woman with red hair in <i>Sensation Comics</i> #2 (1942), written by Wonder Woman's creator William Moulton Marston.</p><p>Enrolled in the fictional Holliday College for Women (and often accompanied by her fellow students, ""the Holliday Girls""), Etta would become a constant feature of Wonder Woman's Golden Age adventures, effectively functioning as both the hero's plucky sidekick and her best friend. Unapologetically proud of her plus-sized figure (and vocal about her love of sweets), ""Etta's appearance was a stark contrast to the svelte, wasp-waisted women depicted in most comic books, and Etta was a brave and heroic leader who was always in the thick of the fight beside her friend Wonder Woman."" Though appearing less frequently in the Silver and Bronze Age, Etta was a recurring presence in Wonder Woman's supporting cast throughout both periods. She would be re-imagined in March 1987 by comics writer/artist George Pérez as part of his post-Crisis relaunch of the Wonder Woman mythos. This milder-mannered version, a former U.S. Air Force captain and intelligence officer, is not presented as Wonder Woman's best friend, but rather as a genial ally among a cast of supporting characters.</p><p>In 2011, Etta was again updated as part of DC Comics' company-wide New 52 continuity reboot. Still an American intelligence specialist, the modern Etta Candy is a Black woman, whose revised history with Wonder Woman restores several Golden Age elements, notably her wise-cracking joie de vivre and her status as the hero's ever-present best friend. Additionally, the New 52 Etta is queer, shown to have a romantic relationship with Barbara Ann Minerva, the British archeologist who would become Wonder Woman's arch-foe the Cheetah. Etta's brassy queerness brings to the surface a consistent lesbian subtext present in William Moulton Marston's original Golden Age characterization of a woman joyously defiant of sex-gender norms. </p><p>Beatrice Colen portrayed Etta in the 1970s <i>Wonder Woman</i> series. The character made her cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe in the 2017 film <i>Wonder Woman</i>, played by Lucy Davis.

A speedster, he first appeared under the alias Impulse and later became the second Kid Flash and the fourth Flash. Created by Mark Waid and Mike Wieringo, Bart first made a cameo in <i>The Flash</i> (vol. 2) #91 in 1994 before his full debut in issue #92. He has since been featured as the lead character in <i>Impulse</i> (1995–2002) and <i>The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive</i> (2006–2007).

First appearing in <i>Batman</i> #357 in March 1983, Todd was created to succeed Dick Grayson as <b>Robin</b>, the superhero Batman's vigilante partner. Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent with a troubled past and a violent demeanor, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentor. </p><p>Though initially popular, the character as written by Jim Starlin was not well received by fans following the revamping of his origin by Max Allan Collins in <i>Batman</i> #408–409. This led to DC Comics holding a telephone poll in 1988's ""A Death in the Family"" storyline to determine whether or not the character would die at the hands of Batman's nemesis, the Joker. The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. Subsequent stories dealt with Batman's guilt over failing to save him. Todd is resurrected in 2005's ""Under the Hood"" story arc and becomes a murderous antihero known as the <b>Red Hood</b>. This transition is retained after the <i>Final Crisis</i> storyline. </p><p>The character has made appearances in several forms of media outside of comics, including television series and video games.

After the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and witnessing Batman spiral into darkness, Tim attempted to convince Dick to resume the role of Robin, stating that ""Batman needs a Robin"". However, Dick refused to return to being Batman's sidekick, and instead Tim was appointed as the third Robin. Neal Adams redesigned the entire <i>Robin</i> costume specifically for Tim Drake's character, with the sole exception of the redesigned ""R"" logo by the late Norm Breyfogle. </p><p>Subsequent stories emphasize Tim's superior detective skills compared to the previous two Robins, which make him more similar to Batman.

Pullman Strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Pullman Strike</b> was two interrelated strikes in 1894 that shaped national labor policy in the United States during a period of deep economic depression. First came a strike by the American Railway Union (ARU) against the Pullman factory in Chicago in spring 1894. When it failed the ARU launched a national boycott against all trains that carried Pullman passenger cars. The nationwide railroad boycott that lasted from May 11 to July 20, 1894, was a turning point for US labor law. It pitted the American Railway Union (ARU) against the Pullman Company, the main railroads, the main labor unions, and the federal government of the United States under President Grover Cleveland. The strike and boycott shut down much of the nation's freight and passenger traffic west of Detroit, Michigan. The conflict began in Chicago, on May 11 when nearly 4,000 factory employees of the Pullman Company began a wildcat strike in response to recent reductions in wages. Most of the factory workers who built Pullman cars lived in the ""company town"" of Pullman just outside of Chicago. It was designed as a model community by its namesake founder and owner George Pullman.</p><p>As the Panic of 1893 shut down much of the economy, railroads stopped purchase of new passenger cars from Pullman. When his company laid off workers and lowered wages, it did not reduce rents, and the workers called for a strike. Among the reasons for the strike were the absence of democracy within the town of Pullman and its politics, the rigid paternalistic control of the workers by the company, excessive water and gas rates, and a refusal by the company to allow workers to buy and own houses. They had not yet formed a union. Founded in 1893 by Eugene V. Debs, the ARU was an organization of railroad workers. Debs brought in ARU organizers to Pullman and signed up many of the disgruntled factory workers. When the Pullman Company refused recognition of the ARU or any negotiations, ARU called a strike against the factory, but it showed no sign of success. To win the strike, Debs decided to stop the movement of Pullman cars on railroads. The over-the-rail Pullman employees (such as conductors and porters) did not go on strike.</p><p>Debs and the ARU called a massive boycott against all trains that carried a Pullman car. It affected most rail lines west of Detroit and at its peak involved some 250,000 workers in 27 states. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) opposed the boycott because the ARU was trying to take its membership. The high prestige railroad brotherhoods of Conductors and Engineers were opposed to the boycott. The Fireman brotherhood—of which Debs had been a prominent leader—was split. The General Managers' Association of the railroads coordinated the opposition. </p><p>Thirty people were killed in riots in Chicago alone. Historian David Ray Papke, building on the work of Almont Lindsey published in 1942, estimated another 40 were killed in other states.

1913 Studebaker strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>1913 Studebaker strike</b> was a labor strike involving workers for the American car manufacturer Studebaker in Detroit. The six-day June 1913 strike, organized by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), is considered the first major labor strike in the automotive industry. </p><p>Early in the year, the IWW, a radical anti-capitalist labor union, began to actively organize Detroit autoworkers, who had become a center of the automotive industry. IWW organizers including Matilda Robbins and James H. Walsh initially attempted to organize at the Ford Motor Company, but following fierce opposition they shifted their focus to Studebaker. The company had recently shifted its pay schedule from weekly to once every two weeks, which was very unpopular with the workers. Tensions escalated even more when a vocal critic of the two-week pay schedule was fired, and about 3,500 workers went on strike on June 17. In the following days this number grew to about 6,000 Studebaker employees and their demands included a weekly pay schedule, improved working conditions and an eight-hour day. By June 19, workers attempted to spread the strike to other car manufacturers, which led to a violent confrontation with police outside of the Packard manufacturing plant and a subsequent city ban on large marches and parades. While the strikers continued to make their demands public and attempted to generate support, Studebaker began hiring strikebreakers. Facing this, the strikers voted to end the strike on June 23. </p><p>During the strike, Studebaker instituted a policy where employees could receive up to 70 percent of their pay halfway through the two-week period, which placated many of the employees. The IWW maintained a presence in the city and planned to target Ford the following year. This, among other reasons, contributed to Ford announcing a $5 daily pay for its workers at a time when the industry average pay was about half of that. The strike was one of several that ended in failure for the IWW in 1913, and the union continued to face both internal and external issues through the following years. In Detroit, organized labor would not gain a stable and sizeable foothold until the 1930s. </p>"	the 1913 studebaker strike was a labor strike involving workers for the american car manufacturer studebaker in detroit the sixday june 1913 strike organized by the industrial workers of the world iww is considered the first major labor strike in the automotive industry early in the year the iww a radical anticapitalist labor union began to actively organize detroit autoworkers who had become a center of the automotive industry iww organizers including matilda robbins and james h walsh initially attempted to organize at the ford motor company but following fierce opposition they shifted their focus to studebaker the company had recently shifted its pay schedule from weekly to once every two weeks which was very unpopular with the workers tensions escalated even more when a vocal critic of the twoweek pay schedule was fired and about 3500 workers went on strike on june 17 in the following days this number grew to about 6000 studebaker employees and their demands included a weekly pay schedule improved working conditions and an eighthour day by june 19 workers attempted to spread the strike to other car manufacturers which led to a violent confrontation with police outside of the packard manufacturing plant and a subsequent city ban on large marches and parades while the strikers continued to make their demands public and attempted to generate support studebaker began hiring strikebreakers facing this the strikers voted to end the strike on june 23 during the strike studebaker instituted a policy where employees could receive up to 70 percent of their pay halfway through the twoweek period which placated many of the employees the iww maintained a presence in the city and planned to target ford the following year this among other reasons contributed to ford announcing a 5 daily pay for its workers at a time when the industry average pay was about half of that the strike was one of several that ended in failure for the iww in 1913 and the union continued to face both internal and external issues through the following years in detroit organized labor would not gain a stable and sizeable foothold until the 1930s	1919 labor strike in Detroit, US	1919 labor strike in detroit us	Companies
1979 Boston University strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>1979 Boston University strike</b> was a labor strike involving employees at Boston University, a private university in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The strike, involving faculty members, clerical workers, and librarians, began on April 5 and was fully ended by April 23. </p><p>The strike has its background in the presidency of John Silber, who became president of the university in 1971. Over the next few years, Silber made many changes that proved unpopular with the university's faculty, and in 1975, the university's chapter of the American Association of University Professors (BU-AAUP) voted to act as a collective bargaining unit. Silber initially challenged the legality of the union, but by 1978, a court ruling mandated that the university had to commence negotiations with the union. Over the next few months, neither side came to a solid agreement, with pay increases being a particular point of contention. </p><p>In early 1979, the union began preparing for strike action, and on April 5, following a disagreement over a tentative agreement that had previously been reached, the union went on strike. That same day, clerical workers and librarians (unionized under the Distributive Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union, respectively) also voted to go on strike, partially in an act of solidarity with the AAUP and partially as a way to receive union recognition. The strike resulted in the cancellation of several hundred classes and particularly affected the College of Liberal Arts. On April 14, the faculty voted to end the strike after the university agreed to the previous tentative agreement, with the provision that they not perform any sort of sympathy strike with other unions. The clerical workers and librarians remained on strike for several more days despite this, and some professors tried to hold classes on locations away from the university as a show of solidarity with the strikers. They finally ended their strike on April 23 after the university agreed to recognize the two unions. </p><p>A year after the strike, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that faculty at private universities were not protected to unionize under the terms of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, and as a result, when the BU-AAUP's contract expired in 1982, the union became decertified. For this reason, historian Gary Zabel calls the strike a Pyrrhic victory for the faculty. </p>"	the 1979 boston university strike was a labor strike involving employees at boston university a private university in boston massachusetts united states the strike involving faculty members clerical workers and librarians began on april 5 and was fully ended by april 23 the strike has its background in the presidency of john silber who became president of the university in 1971 over the next few years silber made many changes that proved unpopular with the universitys faculty and in 1975 the universitys chapter of the american association of university professors buaaup voted to act as a collective bargaining unit silber initially challenged the legality of the union but by 1978 a court ruling mandated that the university had to commence negotiations with the union over the next few months neither side came to a solid agreement with pay increases being a particular point of contention in early 1979 the union began preparing for strike action and on april 5 following a disagreement over a tentative agreement that had previously been reached the union went on strike that same day clerical workers and librarians unionized under the distributive workers of america and the service employees international union respectively also voted to go on strike partially in an act of solidarity with the aaup and partially as a way to receive union recognition the strike resulted in the cancellation of several hundred classes and particularly affected the college of liberal arts on april 14 the faculty voted to end the strike after the university agreed to the previous tentative agreement with the provision that they not perform any sort of sympathy strike with other unions the clerical workers and librarians remained on strike for several more days despite this and some professors tried to hold classes on locations away from the university as a show of solidarity with the strikers they finally ended their strike on april 23 after the university agreed to recognize the two unions a year after the strike the us supreme court ruled that faculty at private universities were not protected to unionize under the terms of the national labor relations act of 1935 and as a result when the buaaups contract expired in 1982 the union became decertified for this reason historian gary zabel calls the strike a pyrrhic victory for the faculty	1979 labor strike in Boston, Massachusetts, United States	1979 labor strike in boston massachusetts united states	Companies
1985 Pan Am strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>1985 Pan Am strike</b> was a labor strike involving several thousand workers, all members of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), at Pan American World Airways. The strike began on February 28 and ended one month later on March 28. </p><p>During the 1980s, Pan Am was struggling financially, and in the early years of the decade, its five labor unions agreed to concessions in order to help the company remain financially stable. However, in December 1984, the labor contracts between Pan Am and the unions expired without replacements, with the unions requesting a lifting of the concessions that had included a pay freeze. TWU, which represented about 5,800 workers in various positions at the company, was especially vocal, and on February 28, after failing to come to an agreement with the company, they went on strike. Initially, the four other unions agreed to honor TWU's picket lines. However, after several days, citing concerns over the negative long-term impact a prolonged strike could have on the company, several unions (including those representing pilots and flight attendants) crossed the picket lines and returned to work. Following this, TWU and Pan Am agreed to meet for negotiations, which occurred throughout March and led to a tentative agreement being reached on March 23. In a narrow vote finalized on March 28, the union agreed to accept the contract (which contained similar provisions to the proposal Pan Am had made TWU before the strike) and ended the strike. While the contract included several concessions, the union also received annual pay increases of 5 percent for the duration of the contract. </p><p>The strike came during a difficult time in the relationship between organized labor and American airlines, with 14 strikes occurring at airlines between 1980 and 1986. Several of these strikes saw a high degree of interunion support. Historian David J. Walsh summarized the strike by saying that, while TWU won some gains alongside some concessions, the union's efforts were hurt by a breakdown in interunion support and genuine concerns from some unions over the negative effects of a long-term strike. Following the strike, Pan Am sold some of its assets in 1985 and in 1991, the company declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. </p>"	the 1985 pan am strike was a labor strike involving several thousand workers all members of the transport workers union of america twu at pan american world airways the strike began on february 28 and ended one month later on march 28 during the 1980s pan am was struggling financially and in the early years of the decade its five labor unions agreed to concessions in order to help the company remain financially stable however in december 1984 the labor contracts between pan am and the unions expired without replacements with the unions requesting a lifting of the concessions that had included a pay freeze twu which represented about 5800 workers in various positions at the company was especially vocal and on february 28 after failing to come to an agreement with the company they went on strike initially the four other unions agreed to honor twus picket lines however after several days citing concerns over the negative longterm impact a prolonged strike could have on the company several unions including those representing pilots and flight attendants crossed the picket lines and returned to work following this twu and pan am agreed to meet for negotiations which occurred throughout march and led to a tentative agreement being reached on march 23 in a narrow vote finalized on march 28 the union agreed to accept the contract which contained similar provisions to the proposal pan am had made twu before the strike and ended the strike while the contract included several concessions the union also received annual pay increases of 5 percent for the duration of the contract the strike came during a difficult time in the relationship between organized labor and american airlines with 14 strikes occurring at airlines between 1980 and 1986 several of these strikes saw a high degree of interunion support historian david j walsh summarized the strike by saying that while twu won some gains alongside some concessions the unions efforts were hurt by a breakdown in interunion support and genuine concerns from some unions over the negative effects of a longterm strike following the strike pan am sold some of its assets in 1985 and in 1991 the company declared bankruptcy and ceased operations	1985 labor strike	1985 labor strike	Companies

These workers, all union members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 111D, worked at two distillery facilities in Clermont and Boston, Kentucky. In 2016, this local union began to negotiate the terms of a new labor contract with the company, and although a tentative agreement had been reached by October 11, it was voted down by a ratio of about ten-to-one by the union members, who also authorized strike action. The primary concerns of the members involved included, among other issues, job security, scheduling, overtime, and the hiring of temporary workers in lieu of permanent, full-time employees. The contract negotiations came during a major boom period in bourbon production, and some workers at the distilleries reported having to work about 70 hours per week. Additionally, the number of temporary workers had increased drastically, and union members were seeking to have this number reduced and for the company to hire more permanent employees. While an updated contract proposal was voted on on October 14, it was similarly rejected by the union members, and with no replacement contract in place as the existing contract expired at midnight, the strike began the next day. </p><p>The strike continued for approximately one week, during which time the company instituted a contingency plan that allowed the distilleries to remain in operation.

2021 Virginia Volvo Trucks strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>2021 Virginia Volvo Trucks strike</b> was a labor strike involving workers at a Volvo Trucks production facility in Dublin, Virginia, United States. The strike began in April and ended in July with the ratification of a new labor contract. </p><p>Of the 3,300 workers at the plant, 2,900 were union members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2069. In March 2021, the labor contract between the union and company expired, and while the union authorized a 30-day extension while both sides continued to negotiate the terms of a replacement, neither side could come to an agreement, with disagreements primarily covering wage increases, job securities, and health care, among other issues. As a result, on April 17, Local 2069 commenced with strike action against the plant, with workers picketing outside while negotiations continued. On April 30, the strike was called off after UAW announced a tentative agreement had been reached with the company. However, members voted to overwhelmingly reject this agreement on May 16 and proceeded to reject a second tentative agreement on June 6. Following this, on June 7, strike action recommenced. About a month after this, on July 9, union members rejected a third tentative agreement that had been reached between UAW and Volvo Trucks. On July 11, the company declared an impasse and stated they would be reopening the plant, with the third tentative agreement serving as their final offer to the union. In a vote held on July 14, union members narrowly voted to accept the terms of the agreement, with strikers returning to work on July 18, thus ending the strike. </p><p>The terms of the new contract included a $2,000 signing bonus for most of the union members, a 12 percent annual wage increase over the six-year life of the contract, and a price freeze on health care premiums for the duration of the contract, among other provisions. </p>"	the 2021 virginia volvo trucks strike was a labor strike involving workers at a volvo trucks production facility in dublin virginia united states the strike began in april and ended in july with the ratification of a new labor contract of the 3300 workers at the plant 2900 were union members of the united auto workers uaw local 2069 in march 2021 the labor contract between the union and company expired and while the union authorized a 30day extension while both sides continued to negotiate the terms of a replacement neither side could come to an agreement with disagreements primarily covering wage increases job securities and health care among other issues as a result on april 17 local 2069 commenced with strike action against the plant with workers picketing outside while negotiations continued on april 30 the strike was called off after uaw announced a tentative agreement had been reached with the company however members voted to overwhelmingly reject this agreement on may 16 and proceeded to reject a second tentative agreement on june 6 following this on june 7 strike action recommenced about a month after this on july 9 union members rejected a third tentative agreement that had been reached between uaw and volvo trucks on july 11 the company declared an impasse and stated they would be reopening the plant with the third tentative agreement serving as their final offer to the union in a vote held on july 14 union members narrowly voted to accept the terms of the agreement with strikers returning to work on july 18 thus ending the strike the terms of the new contract included a 2000 signing bonus for most of the union members a 12 percent annual wage increase over the sixyear life of the contract and a price freeze on health care premiums for the duration of the contract among other provisions	Labor strike in Dublin, Virginia, US	labor strike in dublin virginia us	Companies
2021 Columbia University strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>2021–2022 Columbia University strike</b> was a labor strike involving graduate student workers at Columbia University in New York City. The strike began on March 15, 2021, and ended on May 13, 2021. However, additional strike action commenced on November 3 and lasted until January 7, 2022, when a tentative agreement with the university was reached. The strike was organized by the Graduate Workers of Columbia–United Auto Workers Local 2110 (SWC–UAW), a labor union representing student workers at the university. The goals of the strike were an increase in wages, increased healthcare and childcare coverage, and third-party arbitration in cases of discrimination and sexual harassment. </p><p>While the union voted in March 2020 to authorize strike action, these plans were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in February 2021, still without a labor contract, the union announced their intent to strike the following month. The strike began on March 15 as an open-ended strike action, with no set end date. The strike coincided with a tuition strike that had been coordinated by the local chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America. Picketing and other forms of protest were held at numerous Columbia locations throughout New York City, and multiple elected officials and politicians announced their support for the strikers. On April 19, a contract proposal was submitted for ratification by the union members, but it was rejected in a rank-and-file vote. Following this, a vote was held in early May to determine the future of the strike, with a majority of voters choosing to end the strike, which officially ended on May 13. </p><p>Following the end of the strike, on July 3, new leaders for the union were elected who promised to continue to push for a labor contract with the university. Additionally, the name of the union was changed to the Student Workers of Columbia. While negotiations were set to resume on August 25, disagreements between the two groups led to an impasse, and in late September, the union voted to authorize another strike action. This renewed strike action began on November 3 and continued through late 2021 and into early 2022. Mediation began in late December and on January 7, 2022, the union voted to stop striking after approving a tentative agreement between the university and union that included several concessions to the union, such as increased healthcare and childcare coverage, increased pay, and changes to the arbitration process at Columbia.

Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered based on two aspects: by whether they can issue stock, or by whether they are formed to make a profit. Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as <i>aggregate</i> (the subject of this article) or <i>sole</i> (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office occupied by a single natural person). </p><p>One of the most attractive early advantages business corporations offered to their investors, compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, was limited liability. Limited liability means that a passive shareholder in a corporation will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party. Limited liability in contract is uncontroversial because the parties to the contract could have agreed to it and could agree to waive it by contract. However, limited liability in tort remains controversial because third parties do not agree to waive the right to pursue shareholders. There is significant evidence that limited liability in tort may lead to excessive corporate risk taking and more harm by corporations to third parties.</p><p>Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as <i>stock corporations</i>; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as <i>stockholders</i> or <i>shareholders</i>. Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as <i>non-stock corporations</i>; i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a <i>member</i> of the corporation. Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as <i>for-profit</i> and <i>not-for-profit</i> corporations, respectively. </p><p>There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock. To simplify the explanation, whenever ""stockholder"" or ""shareholder"" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as ""member"" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation. Registered corporations have legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment. </p><p>Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company. </p><p>In American English, the word <i>corporation</i> is most often used to describe large business corporations. In British English and in the Commonwealth countries, the term <i>company</i> is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word <i>corporation</i> encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word <i>company</i> can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a separate legal entity. Late in the 19th century, a new form of the company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as <i>Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung</i> or <i>GmbH</i>. In the last quarter of the 20th century, this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the <i>limited liability company</i> or <i>LLC</i>. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article. </p> <!-- NewPP limit

Corporatization	<p><b>Corporatization</b> is the process of transforming and restructuring state assets, government agencies, public organizations, or municipal organizations into corporations. It involves the adoption and application of business management practices and the separation of ownership from management through the creation of a joint-stock or shareholding structure for the organization. The result of corporatization is the creation of state-owned corporations (or corporations at other government levels, such as municipally owned corporations) where the government retains a majority ownership of the corporation's stock. Corporatization is undertaken to improve efficiency of an organization, to commercialize its operations, to introduce corporate and business management techniques to public functions, or as a precursor to partial or full privatization. </p>	corporatization is the process of transforming and restructuring state assets government agencies public organizations or municipal organizations into corporations it involves the adoption and application of business management practices and the separation of ownership from management through the creation of a jointstock or shareholding structure for the organization the result of corporatization is the creation of stateowned corporations or corporations at other government levels such as municipally owned corporations where the government retains a majority ownership of the corporations stock corporatization is undertaken to improve efficiency of an organization to commercialize its operations to introduce corporate and business management techniques to public functions or as a precursor to partial or full privatization	transformation of publicly owned or governmental organizations into business corporations	transformation of publicly owned or governmental organizations into business corporations	Companies

Rubriq	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Scholarly peer review</b> or <b>academic peer review</b> (also known as <b>refereeing</b>) is the process of having a draft version of a researcher's methods and findings reviewed (usually anonymously) by experts (or ""peers"") in the same field. Peer review helps the academic publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief, the editorial board or the program committee) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected for official publication in an academic journal, a monograph or in the proceedings of an academic conference. </p><p>Academic peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) academic field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scholarly journals. However, peer review does not entirely prevent publication of invalid research, and as experimentally controlled studies of this process are difficult to arrange, direct evidence that peer review improves the quality of published papers is scarce.</p><p>Scholarly peer review has been subject to several criticisms, and various proposals for reforming the system have been suggested over the years. Many studies have emphasized the problems inherent to the process of peer review. (see Squazzoni et al. 2017). Moreover, Ragone et al., (2013) have shown that there is a low correlation between peer review outcomes and the future impact measured by citations. Brezis and Birukou also show that the Peer Review process is not working properly. They underline that the ratings are not robust, e.g., changing reviewers can have a dramatic impact on the review results. Two main elements affect the bias in the peer process.</p> <ul><li>The first element is that referees display homophily in their taste and perception of innovative ideas. So reviewers who are developing conventional ideas will tend to give low grades to innovative projects, while reviewers who have developed innovative ideas tend, by homophily, to give higher grades to innovative projects.</li> <li>The second element leading to a high variance in the peer review process is that reviewers are not investing the same amount of time to analyze the projects (or equivalently are not with the same abilities). Brezis and Biruku show that this heterogeneity among referees will lead to seriously affect the whole peer review process, and will lead to main arbitrariness in the results of the process.</li></ul><p>The peer process is also in use for projects acceptance. (For projects, the acceptance rates are small and are between 1% and 20%, with an average of 10%. In the European H2020 calls, the acceptance rate is 1.8%.) Peer review is more problematic when choosing the projects to be funded since innovative projects are not highly ranked in the existing peer-review process. The peer-review process leads to conformity, i.e., the selection of less controversial projects and papers. This may even influence the type of proposals scholars will propose, since scholars need to find financing for their research as discussed by Martin, 1997: ""A common informal view is that it is easier to obtain funds for conventional projects. Those who are eager to get funding are not likely to propose radical or unorthodox projects. Since you don't know who the referees are going to be, it is best to assume that they are middle-of-the-road. Therefore, the middle-of-the-road application is safer"".</p><p>Other attempts to reform the peer review process originate among others from the fields of metascience and journalology. Reformers seek to increase the reliability and efficiency of the peer review process and to provide it with a scientific foundation. Alternatives to common peer review practices have been put to the test, in particular <i>open peer review</i>, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well, e.g., F1000, <i>eLife</i>, <i>BMJ</i>, and BioMed Central.</p>"	scholarly peer review or academic peer review also known as refereeing is the process of having a draft version of a researchers methods and findings reviewed usually anonymously by experts or peers in the same field peer review helps the academic publisher that is the editorinchief the editorial board or the program committee decide whether the work should be accepted considered acceptable with revisions or rejected for official publication in an academic journal a monograph or in the proceedings of an academic conference academic peer review requires a community of experts in a given and often narrowly defined academic field who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review impartial review especially of work in less narrowly defined or interdisciplinary fields may be difficult to accomplish and the significance good or bad of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scholarly journals however peer review does not entirely prevent publication of invalid research and as experimentally controlled studies of this process are difficult to arrange direct evidence that peer review improves the quality of published papers is scarcescholarly peer review has been subject to several criticisms and various proposals for reforming the system have been suggested over the years many studies have emphasized the problems inherent to the process of peer review see squazzoni et al 2017 moreover ragone et al 2013 have shown that there is a low correlation between peer review outcomes and the future impact measured by citations brezis and birukou also show that the peer review process is not working properly they underline that the ratings are not robust eg changing reviewers can have a dramatic impact on the review results two main elements affect the bias in the peer process the first element is that referees display homophily in their taste and perception of innovative ideas so reviewers who are developing conventional ideas will tend to give low grades to innovative projects while reviewers who have developed innovative ideas tend by homophily to give higher grades to innovative projects the second element leading to a high variance in the peer review process is that reviewers are not investing the same amount of time to analyze the projects or equivalently are not with the same abilities brezis and biruku show that this heterogeneity among referees will lead to seriously affect the whole peer review process and will lead to main arbitrariness in the results of the processthe peer process is also in use for projects acceptance for projects the acceptance rates are small and are between 1 and 20 with an average of 10 in the european h2020 calls the acceptance rate is 18 peer review is more problematic when choosing the projects to be funded since innovative projects are not highly ranked in the existing peerreview process the peerreview process leads to conformity ie the selection of less controversial projects and papers this may even influence the type of proposals scholars will propose since scholars need to find financing for their research as discussed by martin 1997 a common informal view is that it is easier to obtain funds for conventional projects those who are eager to get funding are not likely to propose radical or unorthodox projects since you dont know who the referees are going to be it is best to assume that they are middleoftheroad therefore the middleoftheroad application is saferother attempts to reform the peer review process originate among others from the fields of metascience and journalology reformers seek to increase the reliability and efficiency of the peer review process and to provide it with a scientific foundation alternatives to common peer review practices have been put to the test in particular open peer review where the comments are visible to readers generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well eg f1000 elife bmj and biomed central	process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, or research to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field	process of subjecting an authors scholarly work or research to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field	Companies
Company store	"<p>A <b>company store</b> is a retail store selling a limited range of food, clothing and daily necessities to employees of a company. It is typical of a company town in a remote area where virtually everyone is employed by one firm, such as a coal mine. In a company town, the housing is owned by the company but there may be independent stores there or nearby. </p><p>A company store may also refer to a company's merchandise store, in which fans of a company or brand may purchase clothing and collectibles related to that brand. </p><p>Employee-only company stores often accept scrip or non-cash vouchers issued by the company in advance of periodic cash paychecks, and gives credit to employees before payday. Except in very remote areas, company stores in mining towns became scarcer after the miners bought automobiles and could travel to a range of stores. Even so, the stores could survive because they provided convenience and easy credit. Company stores served numerous additional functions, as well, such as a locus for the government post office, and as the cultural and community center where people could freely gather.</p><p>Company stores have had a reputation as monopolistic institutions, funneling workers' incomes back to the owners of the company. This is because company stores often faced little or no competition for workers' earnings on account of their geographical remoteness, the inability and/or unwillingness of other nearby merchants (if any existed) to accept company scrip, or both. Prices, therefore, were typically high. Allowing purchases on credit enforced a kind of debt slavery, obligating employees to remain with the company until the debt was cleared. </p><p>Regarding this reputation, economic historian Price V. Fishback wrote: </p> <blockquote><p>The company store is one of the most reviled and misunderstood of economic institutions. In song, folktale, and union rhetoric the company store was often cast as a villain, a collector of souls through perpetual debt peonage. Nicknames, like the ""pluck me"" and more obscene versions that cannot appear in a family newspaper, seem to point to exploitation. The attitudes carry over into the scholarly literature, which emphasizes that the company store was a monopoly.</p></blockquote> <p>(The songs Fishback mentions include the popular song ""Sixteen Tons"", which contains such lines as ""Saint Peter, don't you call me, 'cuz I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store."") </p><p>Company stores existed elsewhere than the United States, in particular in the early 1900s in Mexico, where textile workers at the largest cotton mill were paid in scrip.

Shareholders' agreement	<p>A <b>shareholders' agreement</b> (sometimes referred to in the U.S. as a <b>stockholders' agreement</b>) (SHA) is an agreement amongst the shareholders or members of a company. In practical effect, it is analogous to a partnership agreement. It can be said that some jurisdictions fail to give a proper definition to the concept of shareholders' agreement, however particular consequences of this agreements are defined so far. There are advantages of the shareholder's agreement; to be specific, it helps the corporate entity to maintain the absence of publicity and keep the confidentiality. Nonetheless, there are also some disadvantages that should be considered, such as the limited effect to the third parties (especially assignees and share purchasers) and alternation of the stipulated articles can be time consuming. </p>	a shareholders agreement sometimes referred to in the us as a stockholders agreement sha is an agreement amongst the shareholders or members of a company in practical effect it is analogous to a partnership agreement it can be said that some jurisdictions fail to give a proper definition to the concept of shareholders agreement however particular consequences of this agreements are defined so far there are advantages of the shareholders agreement to be specific it helps the corporate entity to maintain the absence of publicity and keep the confidentiality nonetheless there are also some disadvantages that should be considered such as the limited effect to the third parties especially assignees and share purchasers and alternation of the stipulated articles can be time consuming	or stockholders' agreement	or stockholders agreement	Companies

A broad (meta) definition that encompasses many adopted definitions is '“Corporate governance” describes the processes, structures, and mechanisms that influence the control and direction of corporations'. </p><p>This meta definition accommodates both the narrow definitions used in specific contexts and the broader descriptions that are often presented as authoritative. The latter include: the structural definition from the Cadbury Report, which identifies corporate governance as 'the system by which companies are directed and controlled' (Cadbury 1992, p. 15); and the relational-structural view adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 'Corporate governance involves a set of relationships between a company's management, its board, its shareholders and other stakeholders.

Financial law	<p><b>Financial law</b> is the law and regulation of the insurance, derivatives, commercial banking, capital markets and investment management sectors. Understanding Financial law is crucial to appreciating the creation and formation of banking and financial regulation, as well as the legal framework for finance generally. Financial law forms a substantial portion of commercial law, and notably a substantial proportion of the global economy, and legal billables are dependent on sound and clear legal policy pertaining to financial transactions. Therefore financial law as the law for financial industries involves public and private law matters. Understanding the legal implications of transactions and structures such as an indemnity, or overdraft is crucial to appreciating their effect in financial transactions. This is the core of Financial law. Thus, Financial law draws a narrower distinction than commercial or corporate law by focusing primarily on financial transactions, the financial market, and its participants; for example, the sale of goods may be part of commercial law but is not financial law. Financial law may be understood as being formed of three overarching methods, or <i>pillars</i> of law formation and categorised into five <i>transaction silos</i> which form the various financial positions prevalent in finance. </p><p>For the regulation of the financial markets, see Financial regulation which is distinguished from financial law in that regulation sets out the guidelines, framework and participatory rules of the financial markets, their stability and protection of consumers; whereas financial law describes the law pertaining to all aspects of finance, including the law which controls party behaviour in which financial regulation forms an aspect of that law.</p><p>Financial law is understood as consisting of three pillars of law formation, these serve as the operating mechanisms on which the law interacts with the financial system and financial transactions generally. These three components, being market practices, case law, and regulation; work collectively to set a framework upon which financial markets operate. Whilst regulation experienced a resurgence following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the role of case law and market practices cannot be understated. Further, whilst regulation is often formulated through legislative practices; market norms and case law serve as primary architects to the current financial system and provide the pillars upon which the markets depend. It is crucial for strong markets to be capable of utilising both self-regulation and conventions as well as commercially mined case law. This must be in addition to regulation. An improper balance of the three pillars is likely to result in instability and rigidity within the market contributing to illiquidity. For example, the <i>soft law</i> of the <i>Potts QC Opinion</i> in 1997 reshaped the derivatives market and helped expand the prevalence of derivatives. These three pillars are underpinned by several legal concepts upon which financial law depends, notably, legal personality, set-off, and payment which allows legal scholars to categorise financial instruments and financial market structures into five legal silos; those being (1) simple positions, (2) funded positions, (3) asset-backed positions, (4) net positions, and (5) combined positions. These are used by academic Joanna Benjamin to highlight the distinctions between various groupings of transaction structures based on common underpinnings of treatment under the law. The five position types are used as a framework to understand the legal treatment and corresponding constraints of instruments used in finance (such as, for example, a guarantee or asset-backed security.) </p>	financial law is the law and regulation of the insurance derivatives commercial banking capital markets and investment management sectors understanding financial law is crucial to appreciating the creation and formation of banking and financial regulation as well as the legal framework for finance generally financial law forms a substantial portion of commercial law and notably a substantial proportion of the global economy and legal billables are dependent on sound and clear legal policy pertaining to financial transactions therefore financial law as the law for financial industries involves public and private law matters understanding the legal implications of transactions and structures such as an indemnity or overdraft is crucial to appreciating their effect in financial transactions this is the core of financial law thus financial law draws a narrower distinction than commercial or corporate law by focusing primarily on financial transactions the financial market and its participants for example the sale of goods may be part of commercial law but is not financial law financial law may be understood as being formed of three overarching methods or pillars of law formation and categorised into five transaction silos which form the various financial positions prevalent in finance for the regulation of the financial markets see financial regulation which is distinguished from financial law in that regulation sets out the guidelines framework and participatory rules of the financial markets their stability and protection of consumers whereas financial law describes the law pertaining to all aspects of finance including the law which controls party behaviour in which financial regulation forms an aspect of that lawfinancial law is understood as consisting of three pillars of law formation these serve as the operating mechanisms on which the law interacts with the financial system and financial transactions generally these three components being market practices case law and regulation work collectively to set a framework upon which financial markets operate whilst regulation experienced a resurgence following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 the role of case law and market practices can not be understated further whilst regulation is often formulated through legislative practices market norms and case law serve as primary architects to the current financial system and provide the pillars upon which the markets depend it is crucial for strong markets to be capable of utilising both selfregulation and conventions as well as commercially mined case law this must be in addition to regulation an improper balance of the three pillars is likely to result in instability and rigidity within the market contributing to illiquidity for example the soft law of the potts qc opinion in 1997 reshaped the derivatives market and helped expand the prevalence of derivatives these three pillars are underpinned by several legal concepts upon which financial law depends notably legal personality setoff and payment which allows legal scholars to categorise financial instruments and financial market structures into five legal silos those being 1 simple positions 2 funded positions 3 assetbacked positions 4 net positions and 5 combined positions these are used by academic joanna benjamin to highlight the distinctions between various groupings of transaction structures based on common underpinnings of treatment under the law the five position types are used as a framework to understand the legal treatment and corresponding constraints of instruments used in finance such as for example a guarantee or assetbacked security	area of law that regulates insurance, derivatives, commercial banking, capital markets and investment management sectors	area of law that regulates insurance derivatives commercial banking capital markets and investment management sectors	Companies

The original member states of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany.

Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered based on two aspects: by whether they can issue stock, or by whether they are formed to make a profit. Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as <i>aggregate</i> (the subject of this article) or <i>sole</i> (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office occupied by a single natural person). </p><p>One of the most attractive early advantages business corporations offered to their investors, compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, was limited liability. Limited liability means that a passive shareholder in a corporation will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party. Limited liability in contract is uncontroversial because the parties to the contract could have agreed to it and could agree to waive it by contract. However, limited liability in tort remains controversial because third parties do not agree to waive the right to pursue shareholders. There is significant evidence that limited liability in tort may lead to excessive corporate risk taking and more harm by corporations to third parties.</p><p>Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as <i>stock corporations</i>; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as <i>stockholders</i> or <i>shareholders</i>. Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as <i>non-stock corporations</i>; i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a <i>member</i> of the corporation. Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as <i>for-profit</i> and <i>not-for-profit</i> corporations, respectively. </p><p>There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock. To simplify the explanation, whenever ""stockholder"" or ""shareholder"" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as ""member"" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation. Registered corporations have legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment. </p><p>Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company. </p><p>In American English, the word <i>corporation</i> is most often used to describe large business corporations. In British English and in the Commonwealth countries, the term <i>company</i> is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word <i>corporation</i> encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word <i>company</i> can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a separate legal entity. Late in the 19th century, a new form of the company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as <i>Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung</i> or <i>GmbH</i>. In the last quarter of the 20th century, this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the <i>limited liability company</i> or <i>LLC</i>. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article. </p> <!-- NewPP limit

Creature of statute	"<p>A <b>creature of statute</b> (also known as <b>creature of the state</b>) is a legal entity, such as a corporation, created by statute. Creatures of statute may include municipalities and other artificial legal entities or relationships. Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as ""creatures of statute."" The same concept is also expressed with the phrase ""creature of the state.""</p><p>The term ""creature of statute"" is most common to the United States. In the United Kingdom, these bodies are simply called statutory corporations (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the Companies Act 1985 specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (<i>e.g.</i>, a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as ""creatures of statute"" to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. Australia also uses the term ""creature of statute"" to describe some governmental bodies. </p><p>The importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of statute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas. </p>"	a creature of statute also known as creature of the state is a legal entity such as a corporation created by statute creatures of statute may include municipalities and other artificial legal entities or relationships thus when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as creatures of statute the same concept is also expressed with the phrase creature of the statethe term creature of statute is most common to the united states in the united kingdom these bodies are simply called statutory corporations or statutory bodies and generally have some governmental function the united kingdom atomic energy authority is an example in a wider sense most companies in the uk are created under statute since the companies act 1985 specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public but these companies are not called statutory corporations often in american legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies eg a board that governs small businesses in china these bodies are described as creatures of statute to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute australia also uses the term creature of statute to describe some governmental bodies the importance of a corporate body regardless of its exact function when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation thereby the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute the jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body unlike most private corporate bodies creatures of statute can not expand their business interests into other diverse areas	corporation or entity created by statute law	corporation or entity created by statute law	Companies

Corporate haven	"<p>A <b>corporate haven</b>, <b>corporate tax haven</b>, or <b>multinational tax haven</b>, is used to describe a jurisdiction that multinational corporations find attractive for establishing subsidiaries or incorporation of regional or main company headquarters, mostly due to favourable tax regimes (not just the headline tax rate), and/or favourable secrecy laws (such as the avoidance of regulations or disclosure of tax schemes), and/or favourable regulatory regimes (such as weak data-protection or employment laws). </p><p>While the ""headline"" corporate tax rate in jurisdictions most often implicated in base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is always above zero (e.g. Netherlands at 25%, U.K. at 19%, Singapore at 17%, and Ireland at 12.5%), the ""effective"" tax rate (ETR) of multinational corporations, net of the BEPS tools, is closer to zero. To increase respectability, and access to tax treaties, some jurisdictions like Singapore and Ireland require corporates to have a ""substantive presence"", equating to an ""employment tax"" of approximately 2–3% of profits shielded and if these are real jobs, the tax is mitigated. </p><p>In corporate tax haven lists, CORPNET's ""Orbis connections"", ranks the Netherlands, U.K., Switzerland, Ireland, and Singapore as the world's key corporate tax havens, while Zucman's ""quantum of funds"" ranks Ireland as the largest global corporate tax haven. In proxy tests, Ireland is the largest recipient of U.S. tax inversions (the U.K. is third, the Netherlands is fifth). Ireland's double Irish BEPS tool is credited with the largest build-up of untaxed corporate offshore cash in history. Luxembourg and Hong Kong and the Caribbean ""triad"" (BVI-Cayman-Bermuda), have elements of corporate tax havens, but also of traditional tax havens. </p><p>Unlike traditional tax havens, modern corporate tax havens reject they have anything to do with near-zero effective tax rates, due to their need to encourage jurisdictions to enter into bilateral tax treaties which accept the haven's BEPS tools. CORPNET show each corporate tax haven is strongly connected with specific traditional tax havens (via additional BEPS tool ""backdoors"" like the double Irish, the dutch sandwich, and single malt). Corporate tax havens promote themselves as ""knowledge economies"", and IP as a ""new economy"" asset, rather than a tax management tool, which is encoded into their statute books as their primary BEPS tool. This perceived respectability encourages corporates to use these IFCs as regional headquarters (i.e. Google, Apple, and Facebook use Ireland in EMEA over Luxembourg, and Singapore in APAC over Hong Kong/Taiwan. </p><p>Economic Substance legislation introduced in recent years has identified that BEPS is not a material part of the financial services business for Cayman, BVI and Bermuda. While the legislation was originally resisted on extraterritoriality, human rights, privacy, international justice, jurisprudence and colonialism grounds, the introduction of these regulations have had the effect of putting these jurisdictions far ahead of onshore regulatory regimes. </p>"	a corporate haven corporate tax haven or multinational tax haven is used to describe a jurisdiction that multinational corporations find attractive for establishing subsidiaries or incorporation of regional or main company headquarters mostly due to favourable tax regimes not just the headline tax rate andor favourable secrecy laws such as the avoidance of regulations or disclosure of tax schemes andor favourable regulatory regimes such as weak dataprotection or employment laws while the headline corporate tax rate in jurisdictions most often implicated in base erosion and profit shifting beps is always above zero eg netherlands at 25 uk at 19 singapore at 17 and ireland at 125 the effective tax rate etr of multinational corporations net of the beps tools is closer to zero to increase respectability and access to tax treaties some jurisdictions like singapore and ireland require corporates to have a substantive presence equating to an employment tax of approximately 2–3 of profits shielded and if these are real jobs the tax is mitigated in corporate tax haven lists corpnets orbis connections ranks the netherlands uk switzerland ireland and singapore as the worlds key corporate tax havens while zucmans quantum of funds ranks ireland as the largest global corporate tax haven in proxy tests ireland is the largest recipient of us tax inversions the uk is third the netherlands is fifth irelands double irish beps tool is credited with the largest buildup of untaxed corporate offshore cash in history luxembourg and hong kong and the caribbean triad bvicaymanbermuda have elements of corporate tax havens but also of traditional tax havens unlike traditional tax havens modern corporate tax havens reject they have anything to do with nearzero effective tax rates due to their need to encourage jurisdictions to enter into bilateral tax treaties which accept the havens beps tools corpnet show each corporate tax haven is strongly connected with specific traditional tax havens via additional beps tool backdoors like the double irish the dutch sandwich and single malt corporate tax havens promote themselves as knowledge economies and ip as a new economy asset rather than a tax management tool which is encoded into their statute books as their primary beps tool this perceived respectability encourages corporates to use these ifcs as regional headquarters ie google apple and facebook use ireland in emea over luxembourg and singapore in apac over hong kongtaiwan economic substance legislation introduced in recent years has identified that beps is not a material part of the financial services business for cayman bvi and bermuda while the legislation was originally resisted on extraterritoriality human rights privacy international justice jurisprudence and colonialism grounds the introduction of these regulations have had the effect of putting these jurisdictions far ahead of onshore regulatory regimes	jurisdiction favorable to corporations due to low taxes or weak regulations	jurisdiction favorable to corporations due to low taxes or weak regulations	Companies

Corruption	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Corruption</b> is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted with a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain. Corruption may involve many activities which include bribery, influence peddling and embezzlement, and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries. Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most common in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states, and mafia states.</p><p>Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degrees and proportions. Each individual nation allocates domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and the deterrence of crime. Strategies which are undertaken in order to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption. Additionally, global initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 also have a targeted goal which is supposed to substantially reduce corruption in all of its forms.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1388 Cached time: 20220514120846 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.226 seconds Real time usage: 0.306 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 447/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 7195/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1274/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 12/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 4078/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.132/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 2947222/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 281.434 1 -total 32.36% 91.069 2 Template:Cite_web 27.57% 77.590 1 Template:Short_description 16.45% 46.301 1 Template:Citation_needed 14.20% 39.969 1 Template:Fix 13.76% 38.724 1 Template:Pagetype 11.25% 31.665 1 Template:Redirect 8.52% 23.983 2 Template:Category_handler 8.21% 23.104 1 Template:Use_dmy_dates 7.51% 21.138 4 Template:Main_other -->"	corruption is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted with a position of authority in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for ones personal gain corruption may involve many activities which include bribery influence peddling and embezzlement and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries political corruption occurs when an officeholder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain corruption is most common in kleptocracies oligarchies narcostates and mafia statescorruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degrees and proportions each individual nation allocates domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and the deterrence of crime strategies which are undertaken in order to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anticorruption additionally global initiatives like the united nations sustainable development goal 16 also have a targeted goal which is supposed to substantially reduce corruption in all of its forms	form of dishonesty or criminal offense undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, to acquire illicit benefit or abuse power for one's private gain	form of dishonesty or criminal offense undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority to acquire illicit benefit or abuse power for ones private gain	Companies

The reason for the term ""<i>legal</i> person"" is that some legal persons are not people: companies and corporations are ""persons"" legally speaking (they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do), but they are not people in a literal sense. </p><p>There are therefore two kinds of legal entities: human and non-human. In law, a human person is called a <i>natural person</i> (sometimes also a <i>physical person</i>), and a non-human person is called a <i>juridical person</i> (sometimes also a <i>juridic</i>, <i>juristic</i>, <i>artificial</i>, <i>legal</i>, or <i><b>fictitious person</b></i>, Latin: <i lang=""la"">persona ficta</i>). </p><p>Juridical persons are entities such as corporations, firms (in some jurisdictions), and many government agencies. They are treated in law as if they were persons.</p><p>While natural persons acquire legal personality ""naturally"", simply by being born (or before that, in some jurisdictions), juridical persons must have legal personality conferred on them by some ""unnatural"", legal process, and it is for this reason that they are sometimes called ""artificial"" persons. In the most common case (incorporating a business), legal personality is usually acquired by registration with a government agency set up for the purpose. In other cases it may be by primary legislation: an example is the Charity Commission in the UK. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 advocates for the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration by 2030 as part of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>As legal personality is a prerequisite to legal capacity (the ability of any legal person to amend – i.e. enter into, transfer, etc. – rights and obligations), it is a prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its own name. </p><p>The term ""legal person"" can be ambiguous because it is often used as a synonym of terms that refer <i>only</i> to non-human legal entities, specifically in contradistinction to ""natural person"".</p> "	in law a legal person is any person or thing less ambiguously any legal entity that can do the things a human person is usually able to do in law – such as enter into contracts sue and be sued own property and so on the reason for the term legal person is that some legal persons are not people companies and corporations are persons legally speaking they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do but they are not people in a literal sense there are therefore two kinds of legal entities human and nonhuman in law a human person is called a natural person sometimes also a physical person and a nonhuman person is called a juridical person sometimes also a juridic juristic artificial legal or fictitious person latin persona ficta juridical persons are entities such as corporations firms in some jurisdictions and many government agencies they are treated in law as if they were personswhile natural persons acquire legal personality naturally simply by being born or before that in some jurisdictions juridical persons must have legal personality conferred on them by some unnatural legal process and it is for this reason that they are sometimes called artificial persons in the most common case incorporating a business legal personality is usually acquired by registration with a government agency set up for the purpose in other cases it may be by primary legislation an example is the charity commission in the uk the united nations sustainable development goal 16 advocates for the provision of legal identity for all including birth registration by 2030 as part of the 2030 agendaas legal personality is a prerequisite to legal capacity the ability of any legal person to amend – ie enter into transfer etc – rights and obligations it is a prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its own name the term legal person can be ambiguous because it is often used as a synonym of terms that refer only to nonhuman legal entities specifically in contradistinction to natural person	any human or non-human entity that is recognized as having privileges and obligations; a legal fiction which is used to abstract away the differences between natural persons, juridical persons and other entities such as countries	any human or nonhuman entity that is recognized as having privileges and obligations a legal fiction which is used to abstract away the differences between natural persons juridical persons and other entities such as countries	Companies

The Modern Corporation and Private Property	"<p><i><b>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</b></i> is a book written by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means published in 1932 regarding the foundations of United States corporate law. It explores the evolution of big business through a legal and economic lens, and argues that in the modern world those who legally have ownership over companies have been separated from their control. The second, revised edition was released in 1967. It serves as a foundational text in corporate governance, corporate law (company law), and institutional economics. </p><p>Berle and Means argued that the structure of corporate law in the United States in the 1930s enforced the separation of ownership and control because the corporate person formally owns a corporate entity even while shareholders own shares in the corporate entity and elect corporate directors who control the company's activities.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 91"">: 91 </span></sup></b> <i>The Modern Corporation and Private Property,</i> first brought forward issues associated with the widely dispersed ownership of publicly traded companies.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 91"">: 91 </span></sup></b> Berle and Means showed that the means of production in the US economy were highly concentrated in the hands of the largest 200 corporations, and within the large corporations, managers controlled firms despite shareholders' formal ownership.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 91"">: 91 </span></sup></b> Compared to the notion of personal private property, say as one's laptop or bicycle, the functioning of modern company law “has destroyed the unity that we commonly call property.” This occurred for a number of reasons, foremost being the dispersal of shareholding ownership in big corporations: the typical shareholder is uninterested in the day-to-day affairs of the company, yet thousands of people like him or her make up the majority of owners throughout the economy. The result is that those who are directly interested in day-to-day affairs, the management and the directors, have the ability to manage the resources of companies to their own advantage without effective shareholder scrutiny. </p> <blockquote><p>“The property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders his wealth to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely recipient of the wages of capital... [Such owners] have surrendered the right that the corporation should be operated in their sole interest...” “the owners most emphatically will not be served by a profit seeking controlling group”.</p></blockquote> <p>The implications of their work were clear. Berle and Means advocated embedded voting rights for all shareholders, greater transparency, and accountability.

Volkseigener Betrieb	"<p>The <b>Publicly Owned Enterprise</b> (German: <i lang=""de"">Volkseigener Betrieb</i>; abbreviated <b>VEB</b>) was the main legal form of industrial enterprise in East Germany. They were all publicly owned and were formed after mass nationalisation between 1945 and the early 1960s, and the handing back in 1954 of some 33 enterprises previously taken by the Soviet Union as reparations.</p><p>The managing director of a VEB was called a plant or works manager (German: <i>Werkleiter</i>, <i>Werkdirektor</i> or <i>Betriebsdirektor</i>). He or she was assisted by the first secretary of the factory party organisation (<i>Betriebsparteiorganisation</i>) of the SED, and the chairman of the factory trade union (<i>Betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung</i>). Subordinate to them were roles such as ""Chief Accountant"" and ""Technical Director"". </p><p>VEBs were initially vertically integrated into units called Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises (<i>Vereinigung Volkseigener Betriebe</i>, VVBs). A VVB existed in most major industries to consolidate production and reduce waste. They had all been replaced by 1979 with the <i>VEB Kombinate</i>, or VEB Group, which integrated the VEBs much more closely than the largely administrative VVBs. Under this system, the term 'Kombinate' was frequently dropped and the term ""VEB"" usually implied the group rather than the individual factory. The organisation of all state enterprises was the responsibility of the State Planning Commission. </p><p>VEBs often had company sports teams, and played an important role in the promotion of sports. </p><p>In 1989, VEBs employed 79.9% of the East German workforce. After German reunification and the introduction of the market economy in 1990, the ownership of around 8,000 publicly owned enterprises passed to Treuhand, the trust agency which oversaw the privatization of GDR state property. </p><p>An honorary name was frequently added to the firm's actual name, for example, VEB Kombinat Chemische Werke ""Walter Ulbricht"" Leuna.

Proxy fight	"<p>A <b>proxy fight</b>, <b>proxy contest</b> or <b>proxy battle</b> (sometimes even called a <b>proxy war</b>) is an unfriendly contest for the control over an organization. The event usually occurs when a corporation's stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance, often focusing on directorial and management positions. Corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their proxy votes (i.e., votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another) to install new management for any of a variety of reasons. Shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an agent to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf. That agent is the shareholder's proxy.</p><p>In a proxy fight, incumbent directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change. These incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power, including: staggering the boards (i.e., having different election years for different directors), controlling access to the corporation's money, and creating restrictive requirements in the bylaws. As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful; except those waged more recently by hedge funds, which are successful more than 60% of the time. However, previous studies have found that proxy fights are positively correlated with an increase in shareholder wealth.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 8"">: 8 </span></sup></b> </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1376 Cached time: 20220514120913 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.192 seconds Real time usage: 0.233 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 357/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 4713/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 50/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 4244/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.128/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 2684830/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 218.400 1 -total 51.39% 112.226 1 Template:Cite_book 27.26% 59.526 1 Template:Distinguish 13.62% 29.739 1 Template:Rp 12.10% 26.418 1 Template:R/superscript 5.50% 12.016 3 Template:R/where 4.34% 9.470 1 Template:Cite_journal -->"	a proxy fight proxy contest or proxy battle sometimes even called a proxy war is an unfriendly contest for the control over an organization the event usually occurs when a corporations stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance often focusing on directorial and management positions corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their proxy votes ie votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another to install new management for any of a variety of reasons shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an agent to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf that agent is the shareholders proxyin a proxy fight incumbent directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change these incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power including staggering the boards ie having different election years for different directors controlling access to the corporations money and creating restrictive requirements in the bylaws as a result most proxy fights are unsuccessful except those waged more recently by hedge funds which are successful more than 60 of the time however previous studies have found that proxy fights are positively correlated with an increase in shareholder wealth 8	attempting to influence how company shareholders use their proxy votes	attempting to influence how company shareholders use their proxy votes	Companies
Piercing the corporate veil	"<p> <b>Piercing the corporate veil</b> or <b>lifting the corporate veil</b> is a legal decision to treat the rights or duties of a corporation as the rights or liabilities of its shareholders. Usually a corporation is treated as a separate legal person, which is solely responsible for the debts it incurs and the sole beneficiary of the credit it is owed. Common law countries usually uphold this principle of separate personhood, but in exceptional situations may ""pierce"" or ""lift"" the corporate veil.</p><p>A simple example would be where a businessman has left his job as a director and has signed a contract to not compete with the company he has just left for a period of time. If he sets up a company which competed with his former company, technically it would be the company and not the person competing. But it is likely a court would say that the new company was just a ""sham"" or a ""cover""; and that as the new company is completely owned and controlled by one person that the former employee is deliberately choosing to compete, and so is in breach of that non-competing contract. </p><p>Despite the terminology used which makes it appear as though a shareholder's limited liability emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity, the reality is that the entity status of corporations has almost nothing to do with shareholder limited liability. For example, English law conferred entity status on corporations long before shareholders were afforded limited liability. Similarly, the United States' Revised Uniform Partnership Act confers entity status on partnerships, but also provides that partners are individually liable for all partnership obligations. Therefore, this shareholder limited liability emanates mainly from statute.</p>"	piercing the corporate veil or lifting the corporate veil is a legal decision to treat the rights or duties of a corporation as the rights or liabilities of its shareholders usually a corporation is treated as a separate legal person which is solely responsible for the debts it incurs and the sole beneficiary of the credit it is owed common law countries usually uphold this principle of separate personhood but in exceptional situations may pierce or lift the corporate veila simple example would be where a businessman has left his job as a director and has signed a contract to not compete with the company he has just left for a period of time if he sets up a company which competed with his former company technically it would be the company and not the person competing but it is likely a court would say that the new company was just a sham or a cover and that as the new company is completely owned and controlled by one person that the former employee is deliberately choosing to compete and so is in breach of that noncompeting contract despite the terminology used which makes it appear as though a shareholders limited liability emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity the reality is that the entity status of corporations has almost nothing to do with shareholder limited liability for example english law conferred entity status on corporations long before shareholders were afforded limited liability similarly the united states revised uniform partnership act confers entity status on partnerships but also provides that partners are individually liable for all partnership obligations therefore this shareholder limited liability emanates mainly from statute	Temporary rescission of corporate personhood	temporary rescission of corporate personhood	Companies

Stock certificate	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In corporate law, a <b>stock certificate</b> (also known as <b>certificate of stock</b> or <b>share certificate</b>) is a legal document that certifies ownership of a specific number of shares or stock in a corporation. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to dividends, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect the transfer of the shareholding.

Off-site data protection	<p> In computing, <b>off-site data protection</b>, or <b>vaulting</b>, is the strategy of sending critical data out of the main location (<i>off</i> the main <i>site</i>) as part of a disaster recovery plan. Data is usually transported off-site using removable storage media such as magnetic tape or optical storage. Data can also be sent electronically via a remote backup service, which is known as <i>electronic vaulting</i> or <i>e-vaulting</i>. Sending backups off-site ensures systems and servers can be reloaded with the latest data in the event of a disaster, accidental error, or system crash. Sending backups off-site also ensures that there is a copy of pertinent data that isn’t stored on-site. </p><p>Although some organizations manage and store their own off-site backups, many choose to have their backups managed and stored by third parties who specialize in the commercial protection of off-site data. </p>	in computing offsite data protection or vaulting is the strategy of sending critical data out of the main location off the main site as part of a disaster recovery plan data is usually transported offsite using removable storage media such as magnetic tape or optical storage data can also be sent electronically via a remote backup service which is known as electronic vaulting or evaulting sending backups offsite ensures systems and servers can be reloaded with the latest data in the event of a disaster accidental error or system crash sending backups offsite also ensures that there is a copy of pertinent data that isn ’ t stored onsite although some organizations manage and store their own offsite backups many choose to have their backups managed and stored by third parties who specialize in the commercial protection of offsite data	strategy of storing critical backups in a different physical location from the main system	strategy of storing critical backups in a different physical location from the main system	Companies

Apparent authority	"<p>In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and South Africa, <b>apparent authority</b> (also called ""ostensible authority"") relates to the doctrines of the law of agency.

This means a principal is bound by the agent's actions, even if the agent had no <i>actual</i> authority, whether express or implied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance, which he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the authority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even if actual authority has not been given.</p><p>There must be some act or some knowing omission on the part of the principal—if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the <i>presence</i> of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the termination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority. </p><p>In relation to companies, the apparent authority of directors, officers and agents of the company is normally referred to as ""ostensible authority.""

It safeguards assets of asset managers, insurance companies, hedge funds, and is not engaged in ""traditional"" commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. The role of a custodian in such a case would be to: </p> <ul><li>hold in safekeeping assets/securities such as stocks, bonds, commodities such as precious metals and currency (cash), domestic and foreign</li> <li>arrange settlement of any purchases and sales and deliveries in/out of such securities and currency</li> <li>collect information on and income from such assets (dividends in the case of stocks/equities and coupons (interest payments) in the case of bonds) and administer related tax withholding documents and foreign tax reclamation</li> <li>administer voluntary and involuntary corporate actions on securities held such as stock dividends, stock splits, business combinations (mergers), tender offers, bond calls, etc.</li> <li>provide information on the securities and their issuers such as annual general meetings and related proxies</li> <li>maintain currency/cash bank accounts, effect deposits and withdrawals and manage other cash transactions</li> <li>perform foreign exchange transactions</li> <li>often perform additional services for particular clients such as mutual funds; examples include fund accounting, administration, legal, compliance and tax support services</li></ul><p>Using US definitions, a person who owns street name securities and who is not a member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities. Global securities safekeeping practices vary substantially with markets such as the UK, Australia and South Africa encouraging designated securities accounts in order to permit shareholder identification by companies. </p><p>The definition of ""shareholder"" is generally upheld by corporate law rather than securities law.

Cream	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cream</b> is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators"". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.</p><p>Cream skimmed from milk may be called ""sweet cream"" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and ""cheesy"". In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. </p><p>Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. This is also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1444 Cached time: 20220514121235 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.193 seconds Real time usage: 0.256 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 229/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 5898/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 218/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 8/100 Expensive parser function count: 5/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 5954/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.130/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3071873/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 237.787 1 -total 38.09% 90.583 3 Template:Cite_web 32.21% 76.580 1 Template:Short_description 19.13% 45.500 1 Template:Pagetype 17.77% 42.264 1 Template:Pp-semi 9.01% 21.436 1 Template:Other_uses 6.31% 14.997 2 Template:Main_other 4.89% 11.629 1 Template:SDcat 1.22% 2.907 1 Template:Short_description/lowercasecheck -->"	cream is a dairy product composed of the higherfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization in unhomogenized milk the fat which is less dense eventually rises to the top in the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators in many countries it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content it can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets and contains high levels of saturated fatcream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey a byproduct of cheesemaking whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty tangy and cheesy in many countries partially fermented cream is also sold sour cream crème fraîche and so on both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes cream produced by cattle particularly jersey cattle grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat this gives it a slightly yellow tone hence the name of the yellowishwhite color cream this is also the origin of butters yellow color cream from goats milk water buffalo milk or from cows fed indoors on grain or grainbased pellets is white	dairy product	dairy product	Foods

Peynir	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cheese</b> is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. </p><p>Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged for. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries. A <b>cheesemonger</b>, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting the cheeses, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening them.</p><p>For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus <i>Mucor miehei</i>, but others have been extracted from various species of the <i>Cynara</i> thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs. </p><p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century.</p>"	cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein it comprises proteins and fat from milk usually the milk of cows buffalo goats or sheep during production the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate the solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind the outer layer or throughout over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries their styles textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk including the animals diet whether they have been pasteurized the butterfat content the bacteria and mold the processing and how long they have been aged for herbs spices or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents the yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto other ingredients may be added to some cheeses such as black pepper garlic chives or cranberries a cheesemonger or specialist seller of cheeses may have expertise with selecting the cheeses purchasing receiving storing and ripening themfor a few cheeses the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria which turn milk sugars into lactic acid then the addition of rennet completes the curdling vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available most are produced by fermentation of the fungus mucor miehei but others have been extracted from various species of the cynara thistle family cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher lowerpriced milk and lower shipping costs cheese is valued for its portability long shelf life and high content of fat protein calcium and phosphorus cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese hard cheeses such as parmesan last longer than soft cheeses such as brie or goats milk cheese the long storage life of some cheeses especially when encased in a protective rind allows selling when markets are favorable vacuum packaging of blockshaped cheeses and gasflushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century	yellow or white, creamy or solid food made from the pressed curds of milk	yellow or white creamy or solid food made from the pressed curds of milk	Foods

Cheese	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cheese</b> is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. </p><p>Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged for. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries. A <b>cheesemonger</b>, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting the cheeses, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening them.</p><p>For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus <i>Mucor miehei</i>, but others have been extracted from various species of the <i>Cynara</i> thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs. </p><p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century.</p>"	cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein it comprises proteins and fat from milk usually the milk of cows buffalo goats or sheep during production the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate the solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind the outer layer or throughout over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries their styles textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk including the animals diet whether they have been pasteurized the butterfat content the bacteria and mold the processing and how long they have been aged for herbs spices or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents the yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto other ingredients may be added to some cheeses such as black pepper garlic chives or cranberries a cheesemonger or specialist seller of cheeses may have expertise with selecting the cheeses purchasing receiving storing and ripening themfor a few cheeses the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria which turn milk sugars into lactic acid then the addition of rennet completes the curdling vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available most are produced by fermentation of the fungus mucor miehei but others have been extracted from various species of the cynara thistle family cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher lowerpriced milk and lower shipping costs cheese is valued for its portability long shelf life and high content of fat protein calcium and phosphorus cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese hard cheeses such as parmesan last longer than soft cheeses such as brie or goats milk cheese the long storage life of some cheeses especially when encased in a protective rind allows selling when markets are favorable vacuum packaging of blockshaped cheeses and gasflushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century	yellow or white, creamy or solid food made from the pressed curds of milk	yellow or white creamy or solid food made from the pressed curds of milk	Foods

Mennonite cuisine	"<p><b>Mennonite cuisine</b> is food that is unique to and/or commonly associated with Mennonites, a Christian denomination that came out of sixteenth century Protestant Reformation in Switzerland and The Netherlands. Because of persecution, they lived in community and fled to North America, Prussia, and Russia. Groups like the Russian Mennonites developed a sense of ethnicity, which included cuisine adapted from the countries where they lived; thus, the term ""Mennonite cuisine"" does not apply to all, or even most Mennonites today, especially those outside of the traditional ethnic Mennonite groups. Nor is the food necessarily unique to Mennonites, most of the dishes being variations on recipes common to the countries (Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Latin America) where they reside or resided in the past.</p><p>Mennonites do not have any dietary restrictions as exist in some other religious groups.

Filled milk	<p> <b>Filled milk</b> is any milk, cream, or skim milk that has been reconstituted with fats, usually vegetable oils, from sources other than dairy cows. Pure evaporated filled milk is generally considered unsuitable for drinking because of its particular flavor, but is equivalent to unadulterated evaporated milk for baking and cooking purposes. Other filled milk products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream, sour cream, whipping cream, and half-and-half substitutes among other dairy products. Coconut oil filled milk became a popular cost-saving product sold throughout the United States in the early 20th century. Coconut oil could be cheaply imported, primarily from the Philippines (at the time under American rule), and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk. At the time, liquid milk was not widely available or very popular in cities because of the rarity of refrigeration and the problems of transportation and storage. </p>	filled milk is any milk cream or skim milk that has been reconstituted with fats usually vegetable oils from sources other than dairy cows pure evaporated filled milk is generally considered unsuitable for drinking because of its particular flavor but is equivalent to unadulterated evaporated milk for baking and cooking purposes other filled milk products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream sour cream whipping cream and halfandhalf substitutes among other dairy products coconut oil filled milk became a popular costsaving product sold throughout the united states in the early 20th century coconut oil could be cheaply imported primarily from the philippines at the time under american rule and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk at the time liquid milk was not widely available or very popular in cities because of the rarity of refrigeration and the problems of transportation and storage	Milk reconstituted with non-dairy fats	milk reconstituted with nondairy fats	Foods
Cream	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cream</b> is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators"". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.</p><p>Cream skimmed from milk may be called ""sweet cream"" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and ""cheesy"". In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. </p><p>Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. This is also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1444 Cached time: 20220514121235 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.193 seconds Real time usage: 0.256 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 229/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 5898/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 218/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 8/100 Expensive parser function count: 5/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 5954/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.130/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3071873/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 237.787 1 -total 38.09% 90.583 3 Template:Cite_web 32.21% 76.580 1 Template:Short_description 19.13% 45.500 1 Template:Pagetype 17.77% 42.264 1 Template:Pp-semi 9.01% 21.436 1 Template:Other_uses 6.31% 14.997 2 Template:Main_other 4.89% 11.629 1 Template:SDcat 1.22% 2.907 1 Template:Short_description/lowercasecheck -->"	cream is a dairy product composed of the higherfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization in unhomogenized milk the fat which is less dense eventually rises to the top in the industrial production of cream this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators in many countries it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content it can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets and contains high levels of saturated fatcream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey a byproduct of cheesemaking whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty tangy and cheesy in many countries partially fermented cream is also sold sour cream crème fraîche and so on both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes cream produced by cattle particularly jersey cattle grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat this gives it a slightly yellow tone hence the name of the yellowishwhite color cream this is also the origin of butters yellow color cream from goats milk water buffalo milk or from cows fed indoors on grain or grainbased pellets is white	dairy product	dairy product	Foods

Custard	<p><b>Custard</b> is a variety of culinary preparations based on sweetened milk, cheese, or cream cooked with egg or egg yolk to thicken it, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. Depending on the recipe, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (<i>crème anglaise</i>) to the thick pastry cream (<i>crème pâtissière</i>) used to fill éclairs. The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla; however, savory custards are also found, e.g., in quiche. </p><p>Custard is usually cooked in a double boiler (bain-marie), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation, because a temperature increase of 3–6 °C (5–10 °F) leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 °C (~175 °F); it begins setting at 70 °C (~160 °F). A water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles. Adding a small amount of cornflour to the egg-sugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard, allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a double-boiler. A sous-vide water bath may be used to precisely control temperature. </p> 	custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on sweetened milk cheese or cream cooked with egg or egg yolk to thicken it and sometimes also flour corn starch or gelatin depending on the recipe custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce crème anglaise to the thick pastry cream crème pâtissière used to fill éclairs the most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla however savory custards are also found eg in quiche custard is usually cooked in a double boiler bainmarie or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove though custard can also be steamed baked in the oven with or without a water bath or even cooked in a pressure cooker custard preparation is a delicate operation because a temperature increase of 3–6 °c 5–10 °f leads to overcooking and curdling generally a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 °c 175 °f it begins setting at 70 °c 160 °f a water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles adding a small amount of cornflour to the eggsugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a doubleboiler a sousvide water bath may be used to precisely control temperature	variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk	variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk	Foods

The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as ""a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk"".</p><p>Manufacturers state that the composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mother's milk at approximately one to three months postpartum; however, there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products. The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's milk whey and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.</p><p>A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that infant formula prepared in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their <i>Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding</i>, which restated that ""processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission"", and also warned that ""lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality"". </p><p>In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. A formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with <i>Cronobacter sakazakii</i> and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. Although <i>C. sakazakii</i> can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of <i>E. sakazakii</i> infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.</p>"	infant formula baby formula or just formula american english or baby milk infant milk false milk or first milk british english is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age usually prepared for bottlefeeding or cupfeeding from powder mixed with water or liquid with or without additional water the us federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca defines infant formula as a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milkmanufacturers state that the composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mothers milk at approximately one to three months postpartum however there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products the most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cows milk whey and casein as a protein source a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source lactose as a carbohydrate source a vitaminmineral mix and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer in addition there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cows milk mostly in the united states and great britain and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins an upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods including cows milk resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3 and 12monthsa 2001 world health organization who report found that infant formula prepared in accordance with applicable codex alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute in 2003 the who and unicef published their global strategy for infant and young child feeding which restated that processedfood products foryoung children should when sold or otherwise distributed meet applicable standards recommended by the codex alimentarius commission and also warned that lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first halfyear of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality in particular the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment a formulafed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child rarely use of powdered infant formula pif has been associated with serious illness and even death due to infection with cronobacter sakazakii and other microorganisms that can be introduced to pif during its production although c sakazakii can cause illness in all age groups infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection between 1958 and 2006 there have been several dozen reported cases of e sakazakii infection worldwide the who believes that such infections are underreported	manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding of infants	manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding of infants	Foods

The current largest commercial producer in the United Kingdom is Rodda's at Scorrier, Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25 tons of clotted cream a day. In 1998 the 'Cornish clotted cream' was registered as a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) under European Union law. The designation can be used if the production follows certain requirements, from milk produced in Cornwall and the cream has a minimum fat content of 55%. Upon Brexit, the PDO was also registered under UK law.

Curd	<p><b>Curd</b> is obtained by coagulating milk in a sequential process called curdling. It can be a final dairy product or the first stage in cheesemaking. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or <i>curds</i>. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Curds can be used in baking or may be consumed as a snack. </p> 	curd is obtained by coagulating milk in a sequential process called curdling it can be a final dairy product or the first stage in cheesemaking the coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar and then allowing it to coagulate the increased acidity causes the milk proteins casein to tangle into solid masses or curds milk that has been left to sour raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria will also naturally produce curds and sour milk cheeses are produced this way producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents molds for blue cheeses etc are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese the remaining liquid which contains only whey proteins is the whey in cows milk 90 percent of the proteins are caseins curds can be used in baking or may be consumed as a snack	dairy product	dairy product	Foods

Calcium caseinate	<p><b>Calcium caseinate</b> is one of several milk proteins derived from casein in skim and 1% milk. Calcium caseinate is primarily used in meal preparation and fat breakdown. Caseinates are produced by adding an alkali to another derivative of casein, acid casein. The type of caseinate is determined by the cation added alongside the acid casein. Other cations used to form caseinates besides calcium include ammonium, potassium, and sodium. Calcium caseinate contains about 17% glutamic acid. Calcium caseinate is also soluble and does not clot in the stomach.</p>	calcium caseinate is one of several milk proteins derived from casein in skim and 1 milk calcium caseinate is primarily used in meal preparation and fat breakdown caseinates are produced by adding an alkali to another derivative of casein acid casein the type of caseinate is determined by the cation added alongside the acid casein other cations used to form caseinates besides calcium include ammonium potassium and sodium calcium caseinate contains about 17 glutamic acid calcium caseinate is also soluble and does not clot in the stomach	chemical compound	chemical compound	Foods

Eric Gill	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Arthur Eric Rowton Gill</b>, (22 February 1882 – 17 November 1940) was an English sculptor, letter cutter, typeface designer, and printmaker. Although the <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i> describes Gill as ″the greatest artist-craftsman of the twentieth century: a letter-cutter and type designer of genius″, he remains a figure of considerable controversy following revelations of his sexual abuse of two of his daughters. </p><p>Gill was born in Brighton and grew up in Chichester, where he attended the local college before moving to London. There he became an apprentice with a firm of ecclesiastical architects and took evening classes in stone masonry and calligraphy. Gill abandoned his architectural training and set up a business cutting memorial inscriptions for buildings and headstones. He also began designing chapter headings and title pages for books. </p><p>As a young man, Gill was a member of the Fabian Society, but later resigned. Initially identifying with the Arts and Crafts Movement by 1907 he was lecturing and campaigning against the movements perceived failings. He became a Roman Catholic in 1913 and remained so for the rest of his life. Gill established a succession of craft communities, each with a chapel at its centre and with an emphasis on manual labour as opposed to more modern industrial methods. The first of these communities was at Ditchling in Sussex where Gill established the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic for Catholic craftsmen. Many members of the Guild, including Gill, were also members of the Third Order of St. Dominic, a lay division of the Dominican Order. At Ditchling Gill, and his assistants, created several notable war memorials including those at Chirk in north Wales and at Trumpington near Cambridge along with numerous works on religious subjects. </p><p>In 1924, the Gill family left Ditchling and moved to an isolated, disused monastery at Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of Wales. The isolation of Capel-y-ffin suited Gill's wish to distance himself from what he regarded as an increasingly secular and industrialised society and his time there proved to be among the most productive of his artistic career. At Capel, Gill made the sculptures <i>The Sleeping Christ</i> (1925), <i>Deposition</i> (1925) and <i>Mankind</i> (1927). He created engravings for a series of books published by the Golden Cockerel Press, considered among the finest of their kind, and it was at Capel that he designed the typefaces Perpetua, Gill Sans and Solus. After four years at Capel, Gill and his family moved into a quadrangle of properties at Speen in Buckinghamshire. From there, in the last decade of his life Gill became an architectural sculptor of some fame, creating large, high profile, works for central London buildings including both the headquarters of the BBC and the forerunner of London Underground. His mammoth frieze, <i>The Creation of Man</i>, was the British Governments' gift to new League of Nations building in Geneva. Despite failing health Gill was active as a sculptor until the last weeks of his life, leaving several works to be completed by his assistants after his death. </p><p>Gill was a prolific writer on religious and social matters, with some 300 printed works including books and pamphlets to his name. He frequently courted controversy with his opposition to industrialisation, modern commerce and the use of machinery in both the home and workplace. In the years preceding World War II, he embraced pacifism and left-wing causes. </p><p>Gill's religious beliefs did not limit his sexual activity, which included several extramarital affairs. His religious views and subject matter contrast with his deviant sexual behaviour, including, as described in his personal diaries, his sexual abuse of his daughters, an incestuous relationship with at least one of his sisters and sexual experiments with his dog. Since these revelations became public in 1989, there have been a number of calls for works by Gill to be removed from public buildings and art collections. </p>"	arthur eric rowton gill 22 february 1882 – 17 november 1940 was an english sculptor letter cutter typeface designer and printmaker although the oxford dictionary of national biography describes gill as ″the greatest artistcraftsman of the twentieth century a lettercutter and type designer of genius″ he remains a figure of considerable controversy following revelations of his sexual abuse of two of his daughters gill was born in brighton and grew up in chichester where he attended the local college before moving to london there he became an apprentice with a firm of ecclesiastical architects and took evening classes in stone masonry and calligraphy gill abandoned his architectural training and set up a business cutting memorial inscriptions for buildings and headstones he also began designing chapter headings and title pages for books as a young man gill was a member of the fabian society but later resigned initially identifying with the arts and crafts movement by 1907 he was lecturing and campaigning against the movements perceived failings he became a roman catholic in 1913 and remained so for the rest of his life gill established a succession of craft communities each with a chapel at its centre and with an emphasis on manual labour as opposed to more modern industrial methods the first of these communities was at ditchling in sussex where gill established the guild of st joseph and st dominic for catholic craftsmen many members of the guild including gill were also members of the third order of st dominic a lay division of the dominican order at ditchling gill and his assistants created several notable war memorials including those at chirk in north wales and at trumpington near cambridge along with numerous works on religious subjects in 1924 the gill family left ditchling and moved to an isolated disused monastery at capelyffin in the black mountains of wales the isolation of capelyffin suited gills wish to distance himself from what he regarded as an increasingly secular and industrialised society and his time there proved to be among the most productive of his artistic career at capel gill made the sculptures the sleeping christ 1925 deposition 1925 and mankind 1927 he created engravings for a series of books published by the golden cockerel press considered among the finest of their kind and it was at capel that he designed the typefaces perpetua gill sans and solus after four years at capel gill and his family moved into a quadrangle of properties at speen in buckinghamshire from there in the last decade of his life gill became an architectural sculptor of some fame creating large high profile works for central london buildings including both the headquarters of the bbc and the forerunner of london underground his mammoth frieze the creation of man was the british governments gift to new league of nations building in geneva despite failing health gill was active as a sculptor until the last weeks of his life leaving several works to be completed by his assistants after his death gill was a prolific writer on religious and social matters with some 300 printed works including books and pamphlets to his name he frequently courted controversy with his opposition to industrialisation modern commerce and the use of machinery in both the home and workplace in the years preceding world war ii he embraced pacifism and leftwing causes gills religious beliefs did not limit his sexual activity which included several extramarital affairs his religious views and subject matter contrast with his deviant sexual behaviour including as described in his personal diaries his sexual abuse of his daughters an incestuous relationship with at least one of his sisters and sexual experiments with his dog since these revelations became public in 1989 there have been a number of calls for works by gill to be removed from public buildings and art collections	English sculptor, typeface designer, and printmaker (1882-1940)	english sculptor typeface designer and printmaker 18821940	Monuments_and_memorials

Stone carving	<p><b>Stone carving</b> is an activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, stone work has survived which was created during our prehistory or past time. </p><p>Work carried out by paleolithic societies to create stone tools is more often referred to as knapping. Stone carving that is done to produce lettering is more often referred to as lettering.

William Stanford (sculptor)	"<p> <b>William Walter Tyrell Stanford</b> (1839–2 June 1880) was an Australian sculptor. </p><p>Stanford was born in London, England, son of Thomas Tyrell, contractor, and his wife Frances <span title=""Name at birth"">née</span> Trevor. As a youth Stanford was apprenticed to a stonemason. </p><p>Stanford came to Victoria in 1852, probably as a ship's boy, and for a time worked on the gold diggings at Bendigo. In 1854 he was found guilty on a charge of horse-stealing and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at HM Prison Pentridge, near Melbourne. After serving nearly six years, he was released on ticket of leave. On 1 May 1860 Stanford was found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and one of horse-stealing and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Afterward Stanford declared his innocence of two of the charges, and, in the charge of horse-thievery, he said was not the principal actor but assisted a fellow ex-prisoner. Stanford was again imprisoned at Pentridge, to become one of the most insubordinate of all the prisoners and thoroughly hardened. </p><p>The chaplain was impressed Stanford's drawings on a slate and carved bone figure. The carving was shown to Colonel Champ, governor of the prison, who offered Stanford the opportunity to create more art if he promised to improve his behaviour. The chaplain gained permission for Charles Summers to teach Stanford modelling. Later Stanford submitted a design for a fountain which was approved. He only had local bluestone from the prison quarry for construction. Stanford worked for four years on it and became exemplary in his conduct. Summers told his friends about it and many appeals were made for the release of the prisoner. Stanford was ""discharged to freedom by remission"" in October 1871, the fountain was set up in the triangular piece of ground between Parliament House and the treasury building, and there Stanford gave it its finishing touches. It is an excellent piece of design, amazingly successful when the conditions under which it was produced are considered. </p><p>Stanford became a monumental mason at Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne. There he married and was respected and liked by his neighbours. His business was successful and he made a reputation for his carved headstones. One of these may be seen on the main drive of the St Kilda Cemetery not far from the gate. Another example of his work is on his wife's grave at the Melbourne cemetery. Stanford died of ""ulceration of the stomach"" on 2 June 1880 at Prahran, partly from the effects of inhaling the fine dust while working on the fountain. </p>"	william walter tyrell stanford 1839–2 june 1880 was an australian sculptor stanford was born in london england son of thomas tyrell contractor and his wife frances née trevor as a youth stanford was apprenticed to a stonemason stanford came to victoria in 1852 probably as a ships boy and for a time worked on the gold diggings at bendigo in 1854 he was found guilty on a charge of horsestealing and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at hm prison pentridge near melbourne after serving nearly six years he was released on ticket of leave on 1 may 1860 stanford was found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and one of horsestealing and sentenced to 22 years in prison afterward stanford declared his innocence of two of the charges and in the charge of horsethievery he said was not the principal actor but assisted a fellow exprisoner stanford was again imprisoned at pentridge to become one of the most insubordinate of all the prisoners and thoroughly hardened the chaplain was impressed stanfords drawings on a slate and carved bone figure the carving was shown to colonel champ governor of the prison who offered stanford the opportunity to create more art if he promised to improve his behaviour the chaplain gained permission for charles summers to teach stanford modelling later stanford submitted a design for a fountain which was approved he only had local bluestone from the prison quarry for construction stanford worked for four years on it and became exemplary in his conduct summers told his friends about it and many appeals were made for the release of the prisoner stanford was discharged to freedom by remission in october 1871 the fountain was set up in the triangular piece of ground between parliament house and the treasury building and there stanford gave it its finishing touches it is an excellent piece of design amazingly successful when the conditions under which it was produced are considered stanford became a monumental mason at windsor a suburb of melbourne there he married and was respected and liked by his neighbours his business was successful and he made a reputation for his carved headstones one of these may be seen on the main drive of the st kilda cemetery not far from the gate another example of his work is on his wifes grave at the melbourne cemetery stanford died of ulceration of the stomach on 2 june 1880 at prahran partly from the effects of inhaling the fine dust while working on the fountain	Australian sculptor	australian sculptor	Monuments_and_memorials

Together with the <i>Universidad Laboral de Gijón</i>, it is the most prominent example of the original Spanish Neo-Herrerian style, which was intended to form part of a revival of Juan de Herrera's architecture, exemplified by the nearby royal residence El Escorial. This uniquely Spanish architecture was widely used in public buildings of post-war Spain and is rooted in international fascist classicism as exemplified by Albert Speer or Mussolini's Esposizione Universale Roma. </p><p>The monument precinct covers over 3,360 acres (13.6 km<sup>2</sup>) of Mediterranean woodlands and granite boulders on the Sierra de Guadarrama hills, more than 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level and includes a basilica, a Benedictine abbey, a guest house, the Valley, and the <i>Juanelos</i> — four cylindrical monoliths dating from the 16th century. The most prominent feature of the monument is the towering 150-metre-high (500 ft) Christian cross, the tallest such cross in the world, erected over a granite outcrop 150 metres over the basilica esplanade and visible from over 20 miles (32 km) away. Work started in 1940 and took over eighteen years to complete, with the monument being officially inaugurated on 1 April 1959. According to the official ledger, the cost of the construction totalled 1,159 million pesetas, funded through national lottery draws and donations. Some of the labourers were prisoners who traded their labour for a reduction in time served. </p><p>The complex is owned and operated by the Patrimonio Nacional, the Spanish governmental heritage agency, and ranked as the third most visited monument of the Patrimonio Nacional in 2009. The Spanish social democrat government closed the complex to visitors at the end of 2009, citing safety reasons connected to restoration on the façade. The decision was controversial, as the closure was attributed by some people to the Historical Memory Law enacted during José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's premiership, and there were claims that the Benedictine community was being persecuted. The works include the Pietà sculpture prominently featured at the entrance of the crypt, using hammers and heavy machinery. In November 2010, citing safety reasons, the Zapatero government closed down the Basilica for Mass. It was reopened in June 2012. </p> "	the valley of the fallen spanish valle de los caídos spanish pronunciation ˈbaʎe ðe los kaˈiðos is a catholic basilica and a monumental memorial in the municipality of san lorenzo de el escorial erected at cuelgamuros valley in the sierra de guadarrama near madrid dictator francisco franco claimed that the monument was meant to be a national act of atonement and reconciliation it served as the burial place of francos remains from his death in november 1975 until his exhumation on 24 october 2019 as a result of efforts to remove all public veneration of his dictatorship and following a long and controversial legal process the monument considered a landmark of 20thcentury spanish architecture was designed by pedro muguruza and diego méndez on a scale to equal according to franco the grandeur of the monuments of old which defy time and memory together with the universidad laboral de gijón it is the most prominent example of the original spanish neoherrerian style which was intended to form part of a revival of juan de herreras architecture exemplified by the nearby royal residence el escorial this uniquely spanish architecture was widely used in public buildings of postwar spain and is rooted in international fascist classicism as exemplified by albert speer or mussolinis esposizione universale roma the monument precinct covers over 3360 acres 136 km2 of mediterranean woodlands and granite boulders on the sierra de guadarrama hills more than 3000 feet 910 m above sea level and includes a basilica a benedictine abbey a guest house the valley and the juanelos — four cylindrical monoliths dating from the 16th century the most prominent feature of the monument is the towering 150metrehigh 500 ft christian cross the tallest such cross in the world erected over a granite outcrop 150 metres over the basilica esplanade and visible from over 20 miles 32 km away work started in 1940 and took over eighteen years to complete with the monument being officially inaugurated on 1 april 1959 according to the official ledger the cost of the construction totalled 1159 million pesetas funded through national lottery draws and donations some of the labourers were prisoners who traded their labour for a reduction in time served the complex is owned and operated by the patrimonio nacional the spanish governmental heritage agency and ranked as the third most visited monument of the patrimonio nacional in 2009 the spanish social democrat government closed the complex to visitors at the end of 2009 citing safety reasons connected to restoration on the façade the decision was controversial as the closure was attributed by some people to the historical memory law enacted during josé luis rodríguez zapateros premiership and there were claims that the benedictine community was being persecuted the works include the pietà sculpture prominently featured at the entrance of the crypt using hammers and heavy machinery in november 2010 citing safety reasons the zapatero government closed down the basilica for mass it was reopened in june 2012	monument in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain	monument in san lorenzo de el escorial spain	Monuments_and_memorials

Ludlow Massacre	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Ludlow Massacre</b> was a mass killing perpetrated by anti-striker militia during the Colorado Coalfield War. Soldiers from the Colorado National Guard and private guards employed by Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&amp;I) attacked a tent colony of roughly 1,200 striking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado, on April 20, 1914. Approximately 21 people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. John D. Rockefeller Jr., a part-owner of CF&amp;I who had recently appeared before a United States congressional hearing on the strikes, was widely blamed for having orchestrated the massacre.</p><p>The massacre was the seminal event of the 1913–1914 Colorado Coalfield War, which began with a general United Mine Workers of America strike against poor labor conditions in CF&amp;I's southern Colorado coal mines. The strike was organized by miners working for the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company and Victor-American Fuel Company. Ludlow was the deadliest single incident during the Colorado Coalfield War and spurred a ten-day period of heightened violence throughout Colorado. In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, bands of armed miners attacked dozens of anti-union establishments, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 225-mile (362 km) front from Trinidad to Louisville. From the strike's beginning in September 1913 to intervention by federal soldiers under President Woodrow Wilson's orders on April 29, 1914, an estimated 69 to 199 people were killed during the strike. Historian Thomas G. Andrews has called it the ""deadliest strike in the history of the United States.""<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 1"">: 1 </span></sup></p><p>The Ludlow Massacre was a watershed moment in American labor relations. Socialist historian Howard Zinn described it as ""the culminating act of perhaps the most violent struggle between corporate power and laboring men in American history"". Congress responded to public outrage by directing the House Committee on Mines and Mining to investigate the events. Its report, published in 1915, was influential in promoting child labor laws and an eight-hour work day. The Ludlow townsite and the adjacent location of the tent colony, 18 miles (29 km) northwest of Trinidad, Colorado, is now a ghost town. The massacre site is owned by the United Mine Workers of America, which erected a granite monument in memory of those who died that day. The Ludlow tent colony site was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009, and dedicated on June 28, 2009. Subsequent investigations immediately following the massacre and modern archeological efforts largely support some of the strikers' accounts of the event.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1358 Cached time: 20220514121854 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.659 seconds Real time usage: 0.815 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 3428/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 389270/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 153044/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 21/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 60562/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.301/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 7800666/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 687.769 1 -total 54.16% 372.503 1 Template:Infobox_civil_conflict 30.19% 207.612 14 Template:Military_navigation 25.80% 177.415 1 Template:Infobox 18.65% 128.241 13 Template:Campaignbox 13.97% 96.079 5 Template:Cite_book 13.53% 93.079 1 Template:Campaignbox_US_Labor_strikes 10.99% 75.563 1 Template:Colorado_coalfield_war 9.97% 68.559 1 Template:Short_description 6.46% 44.416 3 Template:Rp -->"	the ludlow massacre was a mass killing perpetrated by antistriker militia during the colorado coalfield war soldiers from the colorado national guard and private guards employed by colorado fuel and iron company cfampi attacked a tent colony of roughly 1200 striking coal miners and their families in ludlow colorado on april 20 1914 approximately 21 people including miners wives and children were killed john d rockefeller jr a partowner of cfampi who had recently appeared before a united states congressional hearing on the strikes was widely blamed for having orchestrated the massacrethe massacre was the seminal event of the 1913–1914 colorado coalfield war which began with a general united mine workers of america strike against poor labor conditions in cfampis southern colorado coal mines the strike was organized by miners working for the rocky mountain fuel company and victoramerican fuel company ludlow was the deadliest single incident during the colorado coalfield war and spurred a tenday period of heightened violence throughout colorado in retaliation for the massacre at ludlow bands of armed miners attacked dozens of antiunion establishments destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the colorado national guard along a 225mile 362 km front from trinidad to louisville from the strikes beginning in september 1913 to intervention by federal soldiers under president woodrow wilsons orders on april 29 1914 an estimated 69 to 199 people were killed during the strike historian thomas g andrews has called it the deadliest strike in the history of the united states 1 the ludlow massacre was a watershed moment in american labor relations socialist historian howard zinn described it as the culminating act of perhaps the most violent struggle between corporate power and laboring men in american history congress responded to public outrage by directing the house committee on mines and mining to investigate the events its report published in 1915 was influential in promoting child labor laws and an eighthour work day the ludlow townsite and the adjacent location of the tent colony 18 miles 29 km northwest of trinidad colorado is now a ghost town the massacre site is owned by the united mine workers of america which erected a granite monument in memory of those who died that day the ludlow tent colony site was designated a national historic landmark on january 16 2009 and dedicated on june 28 2009 subsequent investigations immediately following the massacre and modern archeological efforts largely support some of the strikers accounts of the event	attack by Colorado National Guard and mine camp guards on striking coal miners	attack by colorado national guard and mine camp guards on striking coal miners	Monuments_and_memorials

Saint Joseph's Day	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Saint Joseph's Day</b>, also called the <b>Feast of Saint Joseph</b> or the <b>Solemnity of Saint Joseph</b>, is in Western Christianity the principal feast day of Saint Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary and legal father of Jesus Christ, celebrated on 19 March. It has the rank of a solemnity in the Catholic Church. It is a feast or commemoration in the provinces of the Anglican Communion, and a feast or festival in the Lutheran Church. Saint Joseph's Day is the Patronal Feast day for Poland as well as for Canada, persons named Joseph, Josephine, etc., for religious institutes, schools and parishes bearing his name, and for carpenters. It is also Father's Day in some Catholic countries, mainly Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It is not a holy day of obligation for Catholics in the United States. </p><p>19 March was dedicated to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the 10th century, and this custom was established in Rome by 1479. Pope Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution <i>Quo primum</i> (14 July 1570). Originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept, it was re-raised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost, and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class (now called a solemnity), having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept. Since 1969, Episcopal Conferences may, if they wish, transfer it to a date outside Lent. Even if it occurs inside Lent on the usual date of 19 March, it is still observed as a Solemnity of a Saint—this is one of the few times during Lent the Gloria may be said or sung, the vesture is changed from the purple or violet of Lent to white or gold (as it would be for such a solemnity normally), the Collect and the Eucharistic Prayer's Preface and other prayers are from the Solemnity and not Lent, the hymns are more joyful, and the Creed is said. However, the Alleluia is still not used, the Tract being used instead, per Lenten regulations.</p><p>Between 1870 and 1955, an additional feast was celebrated in honor of Saint Joseph as Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Patron of the Universal Church, the latter title having been given to him by Pope Pius IX. Originally celebrated on the third Sunday after Easter with an octave, after <i>Divino Afflatu</i> of Saint Pius X (see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X), it was moved to the preceding Wednesday (because Wednesday was the day of the week specifically dedicated to St. Joseph, St. John the Baptist and local patrons). The feast was also retitled The Solemnity of Saint Joseph. This celebration and its accompanying octave were abolished during the modernisation and simplification of rubrics under Pope Pius XII in 1955. </p><p>At the same time, Pope Pius XII established an additional Feast of ""St. Joseph the Worker"", to be celebrated on 1 May, in order to coincide with the celebration of International Workers' Day (May Day) in many countries. Until this time, 1 May had been the Feast of the Apostles Saint Philip and James, but that Feast was then moved to the next free day, 11 May (and again to 3 May, in 1969, having become free in the meantime). In the new calendar published in 1969, the Feast of Saint Joseph The Worker, which at one time occupied the highest possible rank in the Church calendar, was reduced to an optional Memorial, the lowest rank for a saint's day.</p><p>The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Joseph on the Sunday after Christmas.</p><p>Popular customs among Christians of various liturgical traditions observing Saint Joseph's Day are attending Mass or the Divine Service, wearing red-coloured clothing, carrying dried fava beans that have been blessed, and assembling home altars dedicated to Saint Joseph.</p>"	saint josephs day also called the feast of saint joseph or the solemnity of saint joseph is in western christianity the principal feast day of saint joseph husband of the virgin mary and legal father of jesus christ celebrated on 19 march it has the rank of a solemnity in the catholic church it is a feast or commemoration in the provinces of the anglican communion and a feast or festival in the lutheran church saint josephs day is the patronal feast day for poland as well as for canada persons named joseph josephine etc for religious institutes schools and parishes bearing his name and for carpenters it is also fathers day in some catholic countries mainly spain portugal and italy it is not a holy day of obligation for catholics in the united states 19 march was dedicated to saint joseph in several western calendars by the 10th century and this custom was established in rome by 1479 pope pius v extended its use to the entire roman rite by his apostolic constitution quo primum 14 july 1570 originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept it was reraised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class now called a solemnity having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept since 1969 episcopal conferences may if they wish transfer it to a date outside lent even if it occurs inside lent on the usual date of 19 march it is still observed as a solemnity of a saint—this is one of the few times during lent the gloria may be said or sung the vesture is changed from the purple or violet of lent to white or gold as it would be for such a solemnity normally the collect and the eucharistic prayers preface and other prayers are from the solemnity and not lent the hymns are more joyful and the creed is said however the alleluia is still not used the tract being used instead per lenten regulationsbetween 1870 and 1955 an additional feast was celebrated in honor of saint joseph as spouse of the blessed virgin mary and patron of the universal church the latter title having been given to him by pope pius ix originally celebrated on the third sunday after easter with an octave after divino afflatu of saint pius x see reform of the roman breviary by pope pius x it was moved to the preceding wednesday because wednesday was the day of the week specifically dedicated to st joseph st john the baptist and local patrons the feast was also retitled the solemnity of saint joseph this celebration and its accompanying octave were abolished during the modernisation and simplification of rubrics under pope pius xii in 1955 at the same time pope pius xii established an additional feast of st joseph the worker to be celebrated on 1 may in order to coincide with the celebration of international workers day may day in many countries until this time 1 may had been the feast of the apostles saint philip and james but that feast was then moved to the next free day 11 may and again to 3 may in 1969 having become free in the meantime in the new calendar published in 1969 the feast of saint joseph the worker which at one time occupied the highest possible rank in the church calendar was reduced to an optional memorial the lowest rank for a saints daythe eastern orthodox church celebrates saint joseph on the sunday after christmaspopular customs among christians of various liturgical traditions observing saint josephs day are attending mass or the divine service wearing redcoloured clothing carrying dried fava beans that have been blessed and assembling home altars dedicated to saint joseph	Catholic festival to remember Joseph, husband of Mary	catholic festival to remember joseph husband of mary	Monuments_and_memorials

Tribute album	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>album</b> is a collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at <span role=""math"">33<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>3</span></span> rpm. </p><p>The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the compact cassette during the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s, sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. </p><p>Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or ""mixed"" together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed ""live"", even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some ""live rooms"", have reverberation, which creates a ""live"" sound. Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track. </p><p>Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. Historically, the term ""album"" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later, collections of related 78-rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78-rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an ""album""; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.</p> "	an album is a collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc cd vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl longplaying lp records played at 331⁄3 rpm the album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid1960s to the early 21st century a period known as the album era vinyl lps are still issued though album sales in the 21stcentury have mostly focused on cd and mp3 formats the 8track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the compact cassette during the 1970s and early 1980s the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s most albums are recorded in a studio although they may also be recorded in a concert venue at home in the field or a mix of places the time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years this process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately and then brought or mixed together recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed live even when done in a studio studios are built to absorb sound eliminating reverberation to assist in mixing different takes other locations such as concert venues and some live rooms have reverberation which creates a live sound recordings including live may contain editing sound effects voice adjustments etc with modern recording technology artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones with each part recorded as a separate track album covers and liner notes are used and sometimes additional information is provided such as analysis of the recording and lyrics or librettos historically the term album was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format in musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century later collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in booklike albums one side of a 78rpm record could hold only about 35 minutes of sound when lp records were introduced a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an album the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc minidisc compact audio cassette 8track tape and digital albums as they were introduced	collection of audio recordings	collection of audio recordings	Monuments_and_memorials

Transcription (music)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In music, <b>transcription</b> is the practice of notating a piece or a sound which was previously unnotated and/or unpopular as a written music, for example, a jazz improvisation or a video game soundtrack. When a musician is tasked with creating sheet music from a recording and they write down the notes that make up the piece in music notation, it is said that they created a <i>musical transcription</i> of that recording. Transcription may also mean rewriting a piece of music, either solo or ensemble, for another instrument or other instruments than which it was originally intended. The Beethoven Symphonies transcribed for solo piano by Franz Liszt are an example. Transcription in this sense is sometimes called <i>arrangement</i>, although strictly speaking transcriptions are faithful adaptations, whereas arrangements change significant aspects of the original piece. </p><p>Further examples of music transcription include ethnomusicological notation of oral traditions of folk music, such as Béla Bartók's and Ralph Vaughan Williams' collections of the national folk music of Hungary and England respectively. The French composer Olivier Messiaen transcribed birdsong in the wild, and incorporated it into many of his compositions, for example his <i>Catalogue d'oiseaux</i> for solo piano. Transcription of this nature involves scale degree recognition and harmonic analysis, both of which the transcriber will need relative or perfect pitch to perform. </p><p>In popular music and rock, there are two forms of transcription. Individual performers copy a note-for-note guitar solo or other melodic line. As well, music publishers transcribe entire recordings of guitar solos and bass lines and sell the sheet music in bound books. Music publishers also publish PVG (piano/vocal/guitar) transcriptions of popular music, where the melody line is transcribed, and then the accompaniment on the recording is arranged as a piano part. The guitar aspect of the PVG label is achieved through guitar chords written above the melody. Lyrics are also included below the melody. </p>"	in music transcription is the practice of notating a piece or a sound which was previously unnotated andor unpopular as a written music for example a jazz improvisation or a video game soundtrack when a musician is tasked with creating sheet music from a recording and they write down the notes that make up the piece in music notation it is said that they created a musical transcription of that recording transcription may also mean rewriting a piece of music either solo or ensemble for another instrument or other instruments than which it was originally intended the beethoven symphonies transcribed for solo piano by franz liszt are an example transcription in this sense is sometimes called arrangement although strictly speaking transcriptions are faithful adaptations whereas arrangements change significant aspects of the original piece further examples of music transcription include ethnomusicological notation of oral traditions of folk music such as béla bartóks and ralph vaughan williams collections of the national folk music of hungary and england respectively the french composer olivier messiaen transcribed birdsong in the wild and incorporated it into many of his compositions for example his catalogue doiseaux for solo piano transcription of this nature involves scale degree recognition and harmonic analysis both of which the transcriber will need relative or perfect pitch to perform in popular music and rock there are two forms of transcription individual performers copy a notefornote guitar solo or other melodic line as well music publishers transcribe entire recordings of guitar solos and bass lines and sell the sheet music in bound books music publishers also publish pvg pianovocalguitar transcriptions of popular music where the melody line is transcribed and then the accompaniment on the recording is arranged as a piano part the guitar aspect of the pvg label is achieved through guitar chords written above the melody lyrics are also included below the melody	adaptation of a musical composition to a medium for which it didn't initially write	adaptation of a musical composition to a medium for which it didnt initially write	Monuments_and_memorials

Burial in Anglo-Saxon England	<p> <b>Burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England</b> refers to the grave and burial customs followed by the Anglo-Saxons between the mid 5th and 11th centuries CE in Early Mediaeval England. The variation of the practice performed by the Anglo-Saxon peoples during this period, included the use of both cremation and inhumation. There is a commonality in the burial places between the rich and poor - their resting places sit alongside one another in shared cemeteries. Both of these forms of burial were typically accompanied by grave goods, which included food, jewelry, and weaponry. The actual burials themselves, whether of cremated or inhumed remains, were placed in a variety of sites, including in cemeteries, burial mounds or, more rarely, in ship burials. </p><p>Within the areas of Anglo-Saxon settlement, there was both regional and temporal variation while burial practices. The early Anglo-Saxons were followers of a pagan religion, which is reflected in their burials from this time, while they later converted to Christianity in the seventh and eighth centuries CE, which was again reflected in their burial practices, when cremation ceased to be practised and inhumation became the sole form of burial, typically being concentrated in Christian cemeteries located adjacent to churches. </p><p>In the eighteenth century, antiquarians took an interest in these burials, and began excavating them, although more scientific excavation only began in the twentieth century with the development of archaeology. Prominent Anglo-Saxon burials that have since been discovered and excavated include the early cemetery of Spong Hill in Norfolk and the great sixth-seventh century ship burial of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. </p>	burial in early anglosaxon england refers to the grave and burial customs followed by the anglosaxons between the mid 5th and 11th centuries ce in early mediaeval england the variation of the practice performed by the anglosaxon peoples during this period included the use of both cremation and inhumation there is a commonality in the burial places between the rich and poor their resting places sit alongside one another in shared cemeteries both of these forms of burial were typically accompanied by grave goods which included food jewelry and weaponry the actual burials themselves whether of cremated or inhumed remains were placed in a variety of sites including in cemeteries burial mounds or more rarely in ship burials within the areas of anglosaxon settlement there was both regional and temporal variation while burial practices the early anglosaxons were followers of a pagan religion which is reflected in their burials from this time while they later converted to christianity in the seventh and eighth centuries ce which was again reflected in their burial practices when cremation ceased to be practised and inhumation became the sole form of burial typically being concentrated in christian cemeteries located adjacent to churches in the eighteenth century antiquarians took an interest in these burials and began excavating them although more scientific excavation only began in the twentieth century with the development of archaeology prominent anglosaxon burials that have since been discovered and excavated include the early cemetery of spong hill in norfolk and the great sixthseventh century ship burial of sutton hoo in suffolk	details of Anglo-Saxon burials in England	details of anglosaxon burials in england	Monuments_and_memorials
Maqam (shrine)	"<p>A <b>Maqām</b> (Arabic: <span lang=""ar"" dir=""rtl"">مقام</span>) is a shrine built on the site associated with a religious figure or saint, typical to the regions of Palestine and Syria.

Funerary art	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Funerary art</b> is any work of art forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the dead. The term encompasses a wide variety of forms, including cenotaphs (""empty tombs""), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains, and communal memorials to the dead, such as war memorials, which may or may not contain remains, and a range of prehistoric megalithic constructs. Funerary art may serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centred practices of ancestor veneration or as a publicly directed dynastic display. It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living. </p><p>The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures – Hindu culture, which has little, is a notable exception. Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures – from the Egyptian pyramids and the Tutankhamun treasure, to the Terracotta Army surrounding the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Sutton Hoo ship burial and the Taj Mahal – are tombs or objects found in and around them. In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions. </p><p>An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies. The treasure of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators. A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians. In these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted sarcophagus and tomb monument of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The mausoleum intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in Islamic culture. </p>"	funerary art is any work of art forming or placed in a repository for the remains of the dead the term encompasses a wide variety of forms including cenotaphs empty tombs tomblike monuments which do not contain human remains and communal memorials to the dead such as war memorials which may or may not contain remains and a range of prehistoric megalithic constructs funerary art may serve many cultural functions it can play a role in burial rites serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead whether as part of kinshipcentred practices of ancestor veneration or as a publicly directed dynastic display it can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind as an expression of cultural values and roles and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living the deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures – hindu culture which has little is a notable exception many of the bestknown artistic creations of past cultures – from the egyptian pyramids and the tutankhamun treasure to the terracotta army surrounding the tomb of qin shi huang the mausoleum of halicarnassus the sutton hoo ship burial and the taj mahal – are tombs or objects found in and around them in most instances specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods usually from their possessions an important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies the treasure of the 18th dynasty pharaoh tutankhamun for example though exceptionally lavish was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators a similar division can be seen in grand east asian tombs in other cultures nearly all the art connected with the burial except for limited grave goods was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians in these cultures traditions such as the sculpted sarcophagus and tomb monument of the greek and roman empires and later the christian world have flourished the mausoleum intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world and later common in islamic culture	grave art	grave art	Monuments_and_memorials

Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel	<p>Rock-cut tombs were a form of burial and interment chamber used in ancient Israel. Cut into the landscapes surrounding ancient Judean cities, their design ranges from single chambered, with simple square or rectangular layouts, to multi-chambered with more complex designs. Almost all burial chambers contain a platform for primary burial and an ossuary or other receptacle for secondary burial. There is debate on if these tombs were originally intended for secondary burials, or if that practice arose later.</p><p>The use of rock-cut cave tombs in the region began in the early Canaanite period, from 3100–2900 BCE. The custom lapsed a millennium, however, before re-emerging in the earliest Israelite tombs, dating to the 9th century BCE in Jerusalem. The use of rock-cut tombs reached its peak in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE, before rapidly declining and eventually falling out of use in the 6th century BCE in some regions.</p><p>Use of the tombs has been recorded as recently as the late Roman period around the 3rd century CE.</p><p>The use of such tombs was generally reserved for the middle- and upper-classes, and each typically belonged to a single nuclear or extended family.</p>	rockcut tombs were a form of burial and interment chamber used in ancient israel cut into the landscapes surrounding ancient judean cities their design ranges from single chambered with simple square or rectangular layouts to multichambered with more complex designs almost all burial chambers contain a platform for primary burial and an ossuary or other receptacle for secondary burial there is debate on if these tombs were originally intended for secondary burials or if that practice arose laterthe use of rockcut cave tombs in the region began in the early canaanite period from 3100–2900 bce the custom lapsed a millennium however before reemerging in the earliest israelite tombs dating to the 9th century bce in jerusalem the use of rockcut tombs reached its peak in the 7th and 8th centuries bce before rapidly declining and eventually falling out of use in the 6th century bce in some regionsuse of the tombs has been recorded as recently as the late roman period around the 3rd century cethe use of such tombs was generally reserved for the middle and upperclasses and each typically belonged to a single nuclear or extended family	aspect of history	aspect of history	Monuments_and_memorials

He was the second leader of the Peruvian Aprista Party and to date the only party member ever to have served as President. Mentored by the founder of the APRA, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, he served in the Constituent Assembly of 1978–1979. Elected to the Peruvian Congress in 1980, he rose to the position of General Secretary of the APRA in 1982, and was subsequently elected to the presidency in 1985 in a landslide victory at the age of 35 years. </p><p>García's first presidential term was marked by a severe economic crisis, social unrest and violence. At the conclusion of his first presidency, he was accused and investigated for corruption and illicit enrichment. In 1992, he filed for asylum following president Alberto Fujimori's self-coup, and exiled himself with his family in Colombia and France for the next nine years. In the aftermath of Fujimori's downfall, he made a surprising political comeback as he ran for the presidency in 2001, although he lost in the second round to Alejandro Toledo. In 2006, he was elected to the presidency for a second term, a feat considered an unexpected political resurrection based on the negative legacy of his first term.</p><p>Throughout Garcia's second term, Peru experienced a steady economy, becoming the fastest growing country in Latin America in 2008, surpassing China in terms of rising GDP. The economic success of his presidency would be acclaimed as a triumph by world leaders, and poverty was reduced from 48% to 28% nationally. In addition, Peru signed free trade agreements with the United States and China during García's presidency, but accusations of corruption would persist throughout his term and beyond. He was succeeded by his former 2006 run-off rival Ollanta Humala in 2011. He withdrew from party politics after failing to advance to the second round of the 2016 general election, placing fifth in his bid for a record third presidential term under the Popular Alliance coalition between his party and the Christian People's Party, which included former rival Lourdes Flores as one of his running mates.</p><p>On 17 April 2019, García died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head as police officers under a prosecutor's orders were preparing to arrest him over matters relating to the Odebrecht scandal. He was transferred to a hospital in serious condition, where he remained for more than three hours in an operating room, during which he suffered three cardiorespiratory arrests before his death.</p><p>García is considered one of the most controversial yet talented politicians of Peru's contemporary history.

In addition, he is the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and the Secretary-General of the Central Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. His father, Hafez al-Assad, was the president of Syria before him, serving from 1971 to 2000. </p><p>Born and raised in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the Syrian Army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital in London, specialising in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel died in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian military presence in Lebanon in 1998. </p><p>Political scientists have characterised the Assad family's rule of Syria as a personalist dictatorship. On 17 July 2000, Assad became president, succeeding his father, who died in office a month prior. In the uncontested 2000 and 2007 elections, he received 97.29% and 97.6% support, respectively. On 16 July 2014, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after another election gave him 88.7% of the vote. The election was held only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country's ongoing civil war and was criticised by the UN. Assad was re-elected in 2021 with over 95% of the vote in another non-democratic national election. Throughout his leadership, human rights groups have characterized Syria's human rights situation as poor. The Assad government describes itself as secular, while some political scientists write that his regime exploits sectarian tensions in the country.</p><p>Once seen by many states as a potential reformer, the United States, the European Union, and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad's resignation from the presidency in 2011 after he ordered a violent crackdown on Arab Spring protesters, which led to the Syrian civil war. In December 2013, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that findings from an inquiry by the United Nations implicated Assad in war crimes. The OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism concluded in October 2017 that Assad's government was responsible for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. In June 2014, the American Syrian Accountability Project included Assad on a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels it sent to the International Criminal Court. Assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the American-led intervention in Syria for attempting regime change.</p>"	bashar hafez alassad born 11 september 1965 is a syrian politician who is the 19th president of syria since 17 july 2000 in addition he is the commanderinchief of the syrian armed forces and the secretarygeneral of the central command of the arab socialist baath party his father hafez alassad was the president of syria before him serving from 1971 to 2000 born and raised in damascus bashar alassad graduated from the medical school of damascus university in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the syrian army four years later he attended postgraduate studies at the western eye hospital in london specialising in ophthalmology in 1994 after his elder brother bassel died in a car crash bashar was recalled to syria to take over bassels role as heir apparent he entered the military academy taking charge of the syrian military presence in lebanon in 1998 political scientists have characterised the assad familys rule of syria as a personalist dictatorship on 17 july 2000 assad became president succeeding his father who died in office a month prior in the uncontested 2000 and 2007 elections he received 9729 and 976 support respectively on 16 july 2014 assad was sworn in for another sevenyear term after another election gave him 887 of the vote the election was held only in areas controlled by the syrian government during the countrys ongoing civil war and was criticised by the un assad was reelected in 2021 with over 95 of the vote in another nondemocratic national election throughout his leadership human rights groups have characterized syrias human rights situation as poor the assad government describes itself as secular while some political scientists write that his regime exploits sectarian tensions in the countryonce seen by many states as a potential reformer the united states the european union and the majority of the arab league called for assads resignation from the presidency in 2011 after he ordered a violent crackdown on arab spring protesters which led to the syrian civil war in december 2013 the un high commissioner for human rights navi pillay stated that findings from an inquiry by the united nations implicated assad in war crimes the opcwun joint investigative mechanism concluded in october 2017 that assads government was responsible for the khan shaykhun chemical attack in june 2014 the american syrian accountability project included assad on a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels it sent to the international criminal court assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the americanled intervention in syria for attempting regime change	President of Syria	president of syria	Politicians

The leader of the PAIS Alliance political movement from its foundation until 2017, Correa is a democratic socialist and his administration focused on the implementation of left-wing policies. Internationally, he served as president <i>pro tempore</i> of the UNASUR. </p><p>Born to a lower middle-class mestizo family in Guayaquil, Correa studied economics at the Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, the University of Louvain (UCLouvain), and the University of Illinois, where he received his PhD. Returning to Ecuador, in 2005 he became the Minister for the Economy under President Alfredo Palacio, successfully lobbying Congress for increased spending on health and education projects. </p><p>Correa won the presidency in the 2006 general election on a platform criticizing the established political elites. Taking office in January 2007, he sought to move away from Ecuador's neoliberal economic model by reducing the influence of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He oversaw the introduction of a new constitution, being re-elected in 2009 and again in the 2013 general election. </p><p>Correa's presidency was part of the Latin American pink tide, a turn toward leftist governments in the region, allying himself with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela and bringing Ecuador into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas in June 2009. Using its own form of 21st century socialism, Correa's administration increased government spending, reducing poverty, raising the minimum wage and increasing the standard of living in Ecuador. Between 2006 and 2016, poverty decreased from 36.7% to 22.5% and annual per capita GDP growth was 1.5 percent (as compared to 0.6 percent over the prior two decades). At the same time, inequalities, as measured by the Gini coefficient, decreased from 0.55 to 0.47. By the end of Correa's tenure, the halving of the price of oil since 2014 had caused Ecuador's economy to enter a recession, resulting in government spending being slashed.</p><p>On 3 July 2018, a judge in Ecuador ordered a warrant for the arrest of Correa after he failed to appear in court during a trial surrounding the kidnapping of his political opponent Fernando Balda. Correa, who lived in Belgium at the time, denied the allegations regarding the kidnapping.

Originally a socialist and left-wing nationalist, he is considered to have shifted towards neoliberal policies and the political centre during his presidency.</p><p>Born to a prominent political family affiliated with the ethnocacerist movement, Humala is the son of famed Quechua labour lawyer Isaac Humala. Humala entered the Peruvian Army in 1981, eventually achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. During his time in the military, he fought in the internal conflict against far-left terrorist group Shining Path as well as in the Cenepa War with neighboring Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etat against President Alberto Fujimori during the dying days of his regime; eventually, Congress granted him amnesty and Humala was allowed to return to military duty.</p><p>In 2005, Humala entered electoral politics, founding the Peruvian Nationalist Party (PNP) in order to run in the 2006 presidential election. Having received first place in the first round, he faced former centre-left President and APRA candidate Alan García in the second round, ultimately losing by a narrow margin. His campaign received widespread international attention in 2006 given the recent success of left-wing politicians in Latin America. In 2011, he would once again run for President, and narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori in the runoff. </p><p>Humala's election initially concerned investors, who feared he would govern similar to leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a former ally of his. To assuage these fears, Humala would begin his term by choosing centrists for positions in his cabinet. Humala's unpopular presidency was dominated by corruption scandals surrounding him and his politically influential wife Nadine Heredia. Environmentalists were highly critical of Humala's mining policies, and argued that he reneged on his campaign promise to rein in mining companies.</p><p>In 2017, Humala was arrested by Peruvian authorities on corruption charges.

Party leader	"<p>In a governmental system, a <b>party leader</b> acts as the official representative of their political party, either to a legislature or to the electorate. Depending on the country, the individual colloquially referred to as the ""leader"" of a political party may officially be party chair, secretary, or the highest political office. </p><p>The party leader is often responsible for managing the party's relationship with the general public and leading the competition against political rivals, similar to the role of a party spokesperson. As such, they will take a leading role in developing and communicating party platforms to the electorate. </p><p>In many representative democracies, party leaders compete directly for high political office. It is thus typical in such states (notably in the Westminster system) for the party leader to seek election to the legislature and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's parliamentary leader. In several countries utilizing the parliamentary system, if the party leader's political party emerges with a majority of seats in parliament after a general election, is the leading party in a coalition government, or (in some instances) is the largest party in a minority parliament, that party's leader often serves as the prime minister. This is much harder to do in presidential and semi-presidential systems, where the chief executive is a president who can only be removed by a special impeachment (typically involving a legislative supermajority, an investigation by a constitutional court, or both), and removal entails either a snap election or automatic succession to office by a Vice president; therefore, the party's internal leader either takes a background role (such as the Chairs of the Democratic, and Republican parties in the United States), or the leadership may be automatically bestowed on a sitting President who belongs to the party (such as the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan). In countries using the Westminster system, the leader of the largest political party not within the government serves as the leader of the opposition. </p>"	in a governmental system a party leader acts as the official representative of their political party either to a legislature or to the electorate depending on the country the individual colloquially referred to as the leader of a political party may officially be party chair secretary or the highest political office the party leader is often responsible for managing the partys relationship with the general public and leading the competition against political rivals similar to the role of a party spokesperson as such they will take a leading role in developing and communicating party platforms to the electorate in many representative democracies party leaders compete directly for high political office it is thus typical in such states notably in the westminster system for the party leader to seek election to the legislature and if elected to simultaneously serve as the partys parliamentary leader in several countries utilizing the parliamentary system if the party leaders political party emerges with a majority of seats in parliament after a general election is the leading party in a coalition government or in some instances is the largest party in a minority parliament that partys leader often serves as the prime minister this is much harder to do in presidential and semipresidential systems where the chief executive is a president who can only be removed by a special impeachment typically involving a legislative supermajority an investigation by a constitutional court or both and removal entails either a snap election or automatic succession to office by a vice president therefore the partys internal leader either takes a background role such as the chairs of the democratic and republican parties in the united states or the leadership may be automatically bestowed on a sitting president who belongs to the party such as the democratic progressive party in taiwan in countries using the westminster system the leader of the largest political party not within the government serves as the leader of the opposition	leading official of a political party	leading official of a political party	Politicians

List of places named after Robert Byrd	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>United States Senator Robert Byrd (November 20, 1917 – June 28, 2010) represented the U.S. state of West Virginia as a Democrat in the United States Senate. During his tenure as chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, Byrd secured billions of dollars of Federal funds for projects throughout West Virginia, many of which bear his name. Byrd served four terms as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee: January 3, 1989 through January 3, 1995; January 3, 2001 through January 20, 2001; June 6, 2001 through January 3, 2003; and January 3, 2007, through January 3, 2009. As a New Deal Democrat, Byrd used his position as chairman to battle persistent poverty in his home state of West Virginia, which he referred to as “one of the rock bottomest of states.” ""I lost no opportunity to promote funding for programs and projects of benefit to the people back home,"" said Byrd.“ Within two years of his chairmanship, Byrd surpassed his announced five-year goal of making sure more than $1 billion in Federal funds was sent back to West Virginia. In referring to his economic contributions to West Virginia, Byrd said in 2000, ""West Virginia has always had four friends: God Almighty, Sears Roebuck, Carter's Liver Pills and Robert C. Byrd.""</p><p>Byrd's steering of billions of Federal dollars to West Virginia earned him the sobriquets ""King of Pork"" by the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization Citizens Against Government Waste and ""Prince of Pork"" from other taxpayer groups. According to Citizens Against Government Waste, Byrd was the first legislator to bring $1 billion of ""pork"" spending to his home state. The group named Byrd its initial ""Porker of the Year"" in 2002.</p><p>In addition to providing Federal funding to special projects, Byrd also ensured that many Federal complexes were built in West Virginia, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg, the United States Coast Guard's National Maritime Center in Kearneysville, and a training center and firing range for U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers near Harpers Ferry. Clarksburg's FBI facility was the first of the major Federal complexes to be built under Byrd's leadership as chairman of the appropriations committee. In West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, Byrd helped bring ten federal facilities that employed more than 3,200 people. None of these facilities are named for him, however.</p> <p>More than 50 buildings built with funds from US taxpayers directed to West Virginia are named for either Byrd or his wife, Erma Ora Byrd (née James). Several transportation projects named for Byrd have gained national notoriety, including the Robert C. Byrd Highway. Also known as ""Corridor H"" of the Appalachian Development Highway System, the highway was dubbed ""West Virginia's road to nowhere"" in 2009 after it received a $9.5 million earmark in the $410 billion Omnibus Appropriations Act. The highway received another $21 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Critics argued the traffic on the highway was too light and the cost too high for the project to continue construction until its proposed completion in 2035. The State of West Virginia argued the highway was necessary as ""an ideal evacuation route for Washington, about 100 miles away, in case of an emergency.""</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1402 Cached time: 20220514122621 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.314 seconds Real time usage: 0.375 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 624/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 17010/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 425/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 12/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 16409/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.194/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 4804705/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 338.104 1 -total 34.88% 117.931 1 Template:Cite_news 19.39% 65.560 1 Template:Short_description 16.77% 56.711 7 Template:Cite_web 12.49% 42.214 1 Template:Pp-pc1 9.91% 33.497 1 Template:Pagetype 5.76% 19.479 1 Template:Use_mdy_dates 4.58% 15.497 3 Template:Main_other 3.69% 12.463 1 Template:SDcat 3.62% 12.234 1 Template:DMCA -->"	united states senator robert byrd november 20 1917 – june 28 2010 represented the us state of west virginia as a democrat in the united states senate during his tenure as chairman of the united states senate committee on appropriations byrd secured billions of dollars of federal funds for projects throughout west virginia many of which bear his name byrd served four terms as chairman of the senate appropriations committee january 3 1989 through january 3 1995 january 3 2001 through january 20 2001 june 6 2001 through january 3 2003 and january 3 2007 through january 3 2009 as a new deal democrat byrd used his position as chairman to battle persistent poverty in his home state of west virginia which he referred to as “ one of the rock bottomest of states ” i lost no opportunity to promote funding for programs and projects of benefit to the people back home said byrd “ within two years of his chairmanship byrd surpassed his announced fiveyear goal of making sure more than 1 billion in federal funds was sent back to west virginia in referring to his economic contributions to west virginia byrd said in 2000 west virginia has always had four friends god almighty sears roebuck carters liver pills and robert c byrdbyrds steering of billions of federal dollars to west virginia earned him the sobriquets king of pork by the 501c3 nonprofit organization citizens against government waste and prince of pork from other taxpayer groups according to citizens against government waste byrd was the first legislator to bring 1 billion of pork spending to his home state the group named byrd its initial porker of the year in 2002in addition to providing federal funding to special projects byrd also ensured that many federal complexes were built in west virginia including the federal bureau of investigations criminal justice information services division complex in clarksburg the united states coast guards national maritime center in kearneysville and a training center and firing range for us customs and border protection officers near harpers ferry clarksburgs fbi facility was the first of the major federal complexes to be built under byrds leadership as chairman of the appropriations committee in west virginias eastern panhandle byrd helped bring ten federal facilities that employed more than 3200 people none of these facilities are named for him however more than 50 buildings built with funds from us taxpayers directed to west virginia are named for either byrd or his wife erma ora byrd née james several transportation projects named for byrd have gained national notoriety including the robert c byrd highway also known as corridor h of the appalachian development highway system the highway was dubbed west virginias road to nowhere in 2009 after it received a 95 million earmark in the 410 billion omnibus appropriations act the highway received another 21 million from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 critics argued the traffic on the highway was too light and the cost too high for the project to continue construction until its proposed completion in 2035 the state of west virginia argued the highway was necessary as an ideal evacuation route for washington about 100 miles away in case of an emergency	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Politicians

Bill Clinton	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>William Jefferson Clinton</b> (né <b>Blythe III</b>; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton became known as a New Democrat, as many of his policies reflected a centrist ""Third Way"" political philosophy. He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election. </p><p>Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and he later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation. </p><p>Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. </p><p>Clinton's second term would be dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal which began in 1996, when he began a sexual relationship with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines. The scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached after Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around Clinton using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and that he lied under oath. In 1999 Clinton's impeachment trial begin in the Senate. Clinton was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, the conviction threshold. </p><p>Clinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault against him have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1317 Cached time: 20220514120551 Cache

Political career of John C. Breckinridge	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The political career of John C. Breckinridge included service in the state government of Kentucky, the Federal government of the United States, as well as the government of the Confederate States of America. In 1857, 36 years old, he was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States under James Buchanan. He remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of Southern Democrats, but lost the election to the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln. </p><p>A member of the Breckinridge political family, John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, he was the first Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration. </p><p>In 1859, the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to a U.S. Senate term that would begin in 1861. In the 1860 United States presidential election, Breckinridge captured the electoral votes of most of the Southern states, but finished a distant second among four candidates. Lincoln's election as President prompted the secession of the Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the Civil War, he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the Confederate States Army, and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Confederate States Secretary of War. Then, concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture on May 10, 1865 effectively ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to Cuba, then Great Britain, and finally Canada, remaining in exile until President Andrew Johnson's offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875. </p>"	the political career of john c breckinridge included service in the state government of kentucky the federal government of the united states as well as the government of the confederate states of america in 1857 36 years old he was inaugurated as vice president of the united states under james buchanan he remains the youngest person to ever hold the office four years later he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of southern democrats but lost the election to the republican candidate abraham lincoln a member of the breckinridge political family john c breckinridge became the first democrat to represent fayette county in the kentucky house of representatives and in 1851 he was the first democrat to represent kentuckys 8th congressional district in over 20 years a champion of strict constructionism states rights and popular sovereignty he supported stephen a douglass kansas–nebraska act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the us in the mexican–american war considering his reelection to the house of representatives unlikely in 1854 he returned to private life and his legal practice he was nominated for vice president at the 1856 democratic national convention and although he and buchanan won the election he enjoyed little influence in buchanans administration in 1859 the kentucky general assembly elected breckinridge to a us senate term that would begin in 1861 in the 1860 united states presidential election breckinridge captured the electoral votes of most of the southern states but finished a distant second among four candidates lincolns election as president prompted the secession of the southern states to form the confederate states of america though breckinridge sympathized with the southern cause in the senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully after the confederates fired on fort sumter beginning the civil war he opposed allocating resources for lincoln to fight the confederacy fearing arrest after kentucky sided with the union he fled to the confederacy joined the confederate states army and was subsequently expelled from the senate he served in the confederate army from october 1861 to february 1865 when confederate president jefferson davis appointed him confederate states secretary of war then concluding that the confederate cause was hopeless he encouraged davis to negotiate a national surrender daviss capture on may 10 1865 effectively ended the war and breckinridge fled to cuba then great britain and finally canada remaining in exile until president andrew johnsons offer of amnesty in 1868 returning to kentucky he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875	professional biography	professional biography	Politicians
Political career of Rab Butler (1929–1941)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Richard Austen Butler</b> (9 December 1902 – 8 March 1982), generally known as <b>R. A. Butler</b> and familiarly known from his initials as <b>Rab</b>, was a prominent British Conservative politician. </p><p>Butler was elected to Parliament for Saffron Walden in Essex at the 1929 general election, and soon became a parliamentary assistant to Samuel Hoare, the leading Conservative politician associated with Indian policy. Butler attended the Second Round Table Conference and early in 1932 he visited India on Lord Lothian's Franchise Committee, which recommended an increase in the Indian franchise. Butler became the youngest member of the government, aged 29, in September 1932 when he was appointed Under-Secretary for India. In this position he helped to steer the Government of India Act 1935, which granted provincial self-government to India, through the Commons, in the teeth of strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who spoke for much rank-and-file Conservative opinion in the country. Between May 1937 and February 1938 Butler served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour. </p><p>In February 1938 Butler was moved to be Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, serving under Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Butler, who was often the main Government foreign affairs spokesman in the Commons, was a strong supporter of the appeasement of Nazi Germany. He supported Chamberlain's efforts to negotiate with Adolf Hitler in September 1938, culminating in the Munich Agreement, and after Hitler broke the agreement by occupying Prague in March 1939 Butler continued to urge rapprochement with Germany and – up to the very outbreak of war – to oppose Britain going to war for the sake of Poland. After the outbreak of war he continued to hanker towards a compromise peace, and in June 1940 he had a mysterious meeting with the Swedish trade envoy Björn Prytz, at which he declared that British attitude to peace would be based on ""common sense not bravado"". Thereafter he retained his job at the Foreign Office until May 1941 but appears to have been kept away from serious decision-making. </p><p>Butler's later claims in his memoirs (1971), that he had supported appeasement merely to gain time for rearmament, are not supported by contemporary evidence. Although Butler went on to hold many senior Cabinet offices, his reputation as an appeaser dogged him later in his career, and would be among the factors costing him the party leadership in 1957 and 1963. </p>"	richard austen butler 9 december 1902 – 8 march 1982 generally known as r a butler and familiarly known from his initials as rab was a prominent british conservative politician butler was elected to parliament for saffron walden in essex at the 1929 general election and soon became a parliamentary assistant to samuel hoare the leading conservative politician associated with indian policy butler attended the second round table conference and early in 1932 he visited india on lord lothians franchise committee which recommended an increase in the indian franchise butler became the youngest member of the government aged 29 in september 1932 when he was appointed undersecretary for india in this position he helped to steer the government of india act 1935 which granted provincial selfgovernment to india through the commons in the teeth of strong opposition from winston churchill who spoke for much rankandfile conservative opinion in the country between may 1937 and february 1938 butler served as parliamentary secretary to the ministry of labour in february 1938 butler was moved to be undersecretary of foreign affairs serving under foreign secretary lord halifax and prime minister neville chamberlain butler who was often the main government foreign affairs spokesman in the commons was a strong supporter of the appeasement of nazi germany he supported chamberlains efforts to negotiate with adolf hitler in september 1938 culminating in the munich agreement and after hitler broke the agreement by occupying prague in march 1939 butler continued to urge rapprochement with germany and – up to the very outbreak of war – to oppose britain going to war for the sake of poland after the outbreak of war he continued to hanker towards a compromise peace and in june 1940 he had a mysterious meeting with the swedish trade envoy björn prytz at which he declared that british attitude to peace would be based on common sense not bravado thereafter he retained his job at the foreign office until may 1941 but appears to have been kept away from serious decisionmaking butlers later claims in his memoirs 1971 that he had supported appeasement merely to gain time for rearmament are not supported by contemporary evidence although butler went on to hold many senior cabinet offices his reputation as an appeaser dogged him later in his career and would be among the factors costing him the party leadership in 1957 and 1963	15 March 1991	15 march 1991	Politicians

Alec Douglas-Home	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel</b>, (<span> <span>(<span><span><span></span>listen</span></span>)</span></span>; 2 July 1903 – 9 October 1995) was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1964. He was the only British prime minister born during the Edwardian era, and the last to hold office while a member of the House of Lords, before disclaiming his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two periods serving as Britain's foreign minister than on his brief premiership. </p><p>A talented cricketer, he played first-class cricket at club and county level; he began serving in the Territorial Army from 1924. Douglas-Home (under the courtesy title <b>Lord Dunglass</b>) entered Parliament in 1931 and served as Neville Chamberlain's parliamentary aide, although his diagnosis in 1940 with spinal tuberculosis would immobilise him for two years. Having recovered enough to resume his political career, Douglas-Home lost his seat to Labour at the 1945 general election. He regained it in 1950, but left the Commons the following year when, on the death of his father, he entered the Lords as the <b>14th Earl of Home</b>. Under the next Conservative government, Home was appointed to increasingly senior posts, such as Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post (1960–1963) he supported United States resolve in the Cuban Missile Crisis and was a signatory of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. </p><p>In October 1963, Harold Macmillan resigned as prime minister and Douglas-Home was chosen to succeed him. By the 1960s, it was unacceptable for a prime minister to sit in the House of Lords, so Home disclaimed his hereditary peerage and successfully stood for election to Parliament as <b>Sir Alec Douglas-Home</b>. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two Macmillan Cabinet ministers refused to stay in office under him. Criticised by the Labour Party as an out-of-touch aristocrat, he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with Labour leader Harold Wilson. As prime minister, Douglas-Home's demeanour and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor, Reginald Maudling, free rein to handle financial affairs. He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy and his foreign secretary, Rab Butler, was not especially energetic, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. The Conservative Party, having governed for nearly twelve years, lost its standing after the scandalous Profumo affair under Macmillan and, by Douglas-Home's premiership, seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat; his premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance in 1964. </p><p>Narrowly defeated in the 1964 general election, Douglas-Home resigned the party leadership in July 1965, having instituted a new and less secretive method for electing the leader. He later served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Edward Heath at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1970–1974), an expanded version of his former secretaryship. After the first of the twin Conservative defeats of 1974, he stood down at the second, the October 1974 election, and returned to the Lords as a life peer titled <b>Baron Home of the Hirsel</b>.

He held several senior ministerial posts during this time, most notably those of Viceroy of India from 1926 to 1931 and of Foreign Secretary between 1938 and 1940. He was one of the architects of the policy of appeasement of Adolf Hitler in 1936–1938, working closely with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. However, after Kristallnacht (on 9–10 November 1938) and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 he was one of those who pushed for a new policy of attempting to deter further German aggression by promising to go to war to defend Poland. </p><p>On Chamberlain's resignation early in May 1940, Halifax effectively declined the position of Prime Minister as he felt that Winston Churchill would be a more suitable war leader (Halifax's membership in the House of Lords was given as the official reason).

Olimpia Poznań	"<p><b>Olimpia Poznań</b> is a Polish multi-sport club from Poznań. It has athletics, archery, basketball, boxing, kendo, judo, swimming, tennis, and triathlon sections. The sections are formally independent of each other, sharing the history and name only. The football section, once a top-flight team for many years folded in 2005. </p><p>The club still is a large sports complex surrounded by Lake Rusałka, a large city recreation area: a Tennis Park where the Poznań Open is held; mountain biking facilities including a four-cross track; an athletics stadium (capacity 3000); and a speedway-football stadium (capacity 20 000), which fell into vast disrepair until it was acquired by the city council from the police in 2013 and was renovated. The football-speedway stadium hosts speedway club PSŻ Poznań, rugby union side NKR Chaos, American football team the Poznań Patriots, and football team Poznaniak Poznań. </p><p>The club initially was owned by the civic military police, and therefore for many years the club was considered one of the ""Gwardian"" clubs. For this reason the club was poorly supported compared to the other professional teams in the city, Warta and Lech. </p><p>In the late 80s and 90s the football section was a regular Ekstraklasa team. </p><p>After the fall of communism the club lost its government backing and the club's fortunes started to drastically decline. The club's individual sections became separate entities due to financial issues, several sections were shut down. The club's facilities became outdated and many of them became abandoned and severely under-repaired. The club remained in the hands of the police force, which after 1989 was called Policja (as opposed to Milicja); the police however severely neglected the club and its facilities, as did the management of the club causing all the sections to close one by one, with the surviving ones only doing so through acting independently of and separating themselves from the parent club. </p><p>In 1995 the football section of <b>Olimpia Poznań</b> was moved from Poznań and merged with Lechia Gdańsk in 1995 creating Olimpia-Lechia Gdańsk. The Olimpia-Lechia Gdańsk merger lasted only one season before both clubs were separate entities again. For Lechia they were already in the third division by 1997. The club tried to rescue its fall through another merger with local club Polonia Gdańsk and changing its name to Lechia-Polonia Gdańsk, with Antoni Ptak's company as the main sponsor. In 2001 Lechia decided to leave the merger, and started as an independent club from the bottom of the football pyramid as the sole legal and spiritual continuation of BKS Lechia, which folded the merged club in 2002. Polonia also had to restart from the bottom of the footballing pyramid after they set up an independent club from the merger in 1999. </p><p>After the 1995 merger, the reserve football team became the senior side, which then played in the IV liga. However the stadium fell into the disrepair, the club's finances were mismanaged and the club fell into obscurity, as well as allegations of corruption and involvement of organised crime groups in its structures. </p><p>Finally in 2005 the football section was dissolved, however the judo and tennis sections which has long severed its police ties have thrived. The basketball teams, in particular the women's side has some success and support in recent years, due to lack of competition in the sport of other clubs, however the basketball section too fell into obscurity. The football-speedway stadium was restored mostly thanks to the efforts of speedway fans and activists of PSŻ Poznań, supported by several other sports. </p>"	olimpia poznań is a polish multisport club from poznań it has athletics archery basketball boxing kendo judo swimming tennis and triathlon sections the sections are formally independent of each other sharing the history and name only the football section once a topflight team for many years folded in 2005 the club still is a large sports complex surrounded by lake rusałka a large city recreation area a tennis park where the poznań open is held mountain biking facilities including a fourcross track an athletics stadium capacity 3000 and a speedwayfootball stadium capacity 20 000 which fell into vast disrepair until it was acquired by the city council from the police in 2013 and was renovated the footballspeedway stadium hosts speedway club psż poznań rugby union side nkr chaos american football team the poznań patriots and football team poznaniak poznań the club initially was owned by the civic military police and therefore for many years the club was considered one of the gwardian clubs for this reason the club was poorly supported compared to the other professional teams in the city warta and lech in the late 80s and 90s the football section was a regular ekstraklasa team after the fall of communism the club lost its government backing and the clubs fortunes started to drastically decline the clubs individual sections became separate entities due to financial issues several sections were shut down the clubs facilities became outdated and many of them became abandoned and severely underrepaired the club remained in the hands of the police force which after 1989 was called policja as opposed to milicja the police however severely neglected the club and its facilities as did the management of the club causing all the sections to close one by one with the surviving ones only doing so through acting independently of and separating themselves from the parent club in 1995 the football section of olimpia poznań was moved from poznań and merged with lechia gdańsk in 1995 creating olimpialechia gdańsk the olimpialechia gdańsk merger lasted only one season before both clubs were separate entities again for lechia they were already in the third division by 1997 the club tried to rescue its fall through another merger with local club polonia gdańsk and changing its name to lechiapolonia gdańsk with antoni ptaks company as the main sponsor in 2001 lechia decided to leave the merger and started as an independent club from the bottom of the football pyramid as the sole legal and spiritual continuation of bks lechia which folded the merged club in 2002 polonia also had to restart from the bottom of the footballing pyramid after they set up an independent club from the merger in 1999 after the 1995 merger the reserve football team became the senior side which then played in the iv liga however the stadium fell into the disrepair the clubs finances were mismanaged and the club fell into obscurity as well as allegations of corruption and involvement of organised crime groups in its structures finally in 2005 the football section was dissolved however the judo and tennis sections which has long severed its police ties have thrived the basketball teams in particular the womens side has some success and support in recent years due to lack of competition in the sport of other clubs however the basketball section too fell into obscurity the footballspeedway stadium was restored mostly thanks to the efforts of speedway fans and activists of psż poznań supported by several other sports	Polish multi-sport club from Poznań	polish multisport club from poznań	Sports_teams

Green Bay Packers	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Green Bay Packers</b> are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919, and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since 1957. </p><p>The Packers are the last of the ""small town teams"" which were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s. Founded in 1919 by Earl ""Curly"" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team. Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America, <i>Forbes</i> ranked the Packers as the world's 27th most valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63 billion.</p><p>The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967 and were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) prior to the AFL–NFL merger. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is named after the Packers' coach Vince Lombardi, who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two subsequent Super Bowl wins came in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy. Additionally, the Packers have recorded the most wins (804) and the highest win–loss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games. The Packers are long-standing adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL's NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played over 100 games against each of those teams through history, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys.

Tham Luang cave rescue	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In June and July 2018, a junior association football team was rescued from the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand. Twelve members of the team, aged eleven to sixteen, and their 25-year-old assistant coach entered the cave on 23 June after a football practice session. Shortly afterwards, heavy rainfall partially flooded the cave system, blocking their way out and trapping them deep within. </p><p>Efforts to locate the group were hampered by rising water levels and strong currents, and no contact was made for nearly two weeks. The cave rescue effort expanded into a massive operation amid intense worldwide public interest and involving international rescue teams. On 2 July, after advancing through narrow passages and muddy waters, British divers John Volanthen and Richard Stanton found the group alive on an elevated rock about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the cave mouth. Rescue organisers discussed various options for extracting the group, including whether to teach them basic underwater diving skills to enable their early rescue, to wait until a new entrance to the cave was found or drilled, or to wait for the floodwaters to subside by the end of the monsoon season months later. After days of pumping water from the cave system and a respite from rain, the rescue teams hastened to get the group out of the cave before the next monsoon rain, which was expected to bring additional downpours and was predicted to start around 11 July. </p><p>Between 8 and 10 July, all twelve of the boys and their coach were rescued from the cave by an international team.</p><p>The rescue effort involved more than 10,000 people, including more than 100 divers, scores of rescue workers, representatives from about 100 governmental agencies, 900 police officers, and 2,000 soldiers.

It also sends up tabloid newspapers, with mockeries of articles and letters pages. It features parody competitions and advertisements for overpriced 'limited edition' tat, as well as obsessions with half-forgotten kitsch celebrities from the 1960s to the 1980s, such as Shakin' Stevens and Rodney Bewes. Occasionally, it satirises current affairs and politicians, but it has no particular political standpoint. </p><p>Its success in the early 1990s led to the appearance of numerous rivals copying the format <i>Viz</i> pioneered; none of them managed to attain its popularity. Circulation peaked at 1.2 million in the early 1990s, making it the third-most popular magazine in the UK, but ABC-audited sales have since dropped, to an average of 48,588 per issue in 2018.

List of defunct and relocated National Hockey League teams	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional men's ice hockey league, founded in 1917. The NHL Board of Governors review and approve the relocation of any member club. Each team appoints an individual or individuals to represent their team on the Board of Governors. A majority vote is needed for relocation of a club. Clubs are considered permanently relocated when moved out of their respective home territories, which includes the city that they were located in, plus 50 miles from the city's corporate limits.</p><p>Under the constitution of the NHL, membership is on a partnership basis, each partner holding a franchise from the League for the operation of a hockey club in its designated city. The franchise can out-live teams located in different cities. For example, the Kansas City Scouts, Colorado Rockies, and New Jersey Devils are one franchise. A franchise's history includes the records of competition won in different cities, as differently-named teams. Naming and team logos and designs are registered with the league. Two current teams use the names of previous franchises – the Ottawa Senators and Winnipeg Jets. These franchises do not include the history of the previous franchises, but have used the original franchises' logos and jersey designs. The league considers the history of the current Ottawa Senators to not include the original Senators; the Jets' franchise history includes the Atlanta Thrashers' history, not the first Winnipeg Jets (now the Arizona Coyotes). </p><p>There are 19 defunct and relocated NHL teams. The Montreal Wanderers, original Ottawa Senators, and the Quebec Bulldogs had played in the NHA before joining the NHL; Quebec City joined the NHL two years later as the Athletics. The Pittsburgh Pirates played in the U.S. Amateur Hockey Association as the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets before joining the NHL in 1925. The first NHL team to disband was the Montreal Wanderers, citing the lack of available players due to World War I. The first team to relocate was the Athletics, who relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Tigers. The NHL president at the time, Frank Calder, stripped the franchise from owner Mike Quinn and sold it to a Hamilton-based company. Three franchises became defunct due to the Great Depression: the Philadelphia Quakers, the St. Louis Eagles, and the Montreal Maroons. During their time in the NHL, the Senators and Maroons both won the Stanley Cup championship multiple times, with four and two respectively. The Brooklyn Americans was the last team to become defunct in the NHL. The franchise was struggling financially and, due to the lack of players because of World War II, was suspended prior to the 1942–43 season. The franchise formally ceased in 1946. The Americans' departure reduced the number of teams to six. This began what became known as the Original Six era of the NHL. </p><p>The Original Six era ended when the NHL expanded twofold in 1967. Two teams from the expansion—the California Golden Seals and the Minnesota North Stars—relocated to other cities. The Golden Seals moved to Cleveland after nine seasons in the San Francisco Bay Area to become the Cleveland Barons; this was the first time in four decades the NHL approved a franchise relocation. Two years later, after failed overtures towards merging with the Washington Capitals and the Vancouver Canucks, the Barons merged with the North Stars. The Barons are the only NHL team to merge operations with another one. The North Stars relocated to Dallas in 1993 to become the Stars.</p><p>After six additional expansion teams, the merger of the Cleveland Barons with the Minnesota North Stars, and the NHL–WHA merger, the league had expanded to 21 teams by 1979. Three of the four teams from the NHL–WHA merger relocated to other cities: the Quebec Nordiques, the original Winnipeg Jets, and the Hartford Whalers. The Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, while the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014, with the Hartford Whalers moving to North Carolina and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The Winnipeg Jets identity was revived in 2011, when a Winnipeg-based company received approval from the league to purchase the struggling Atlanta Thrashers and relocate them to Winnipeg for the 2011–12 season. Out of the seven active relocated franchises in the NHL, two have not yet won the Stanley Cup championship: the Coyotes and the Jets (both teams have also never been to the Stanley Cup Finals).</p><p>Most of the metropolitan areas that have hosted relocated or defunct teams have been given another NHL team. Montreal, Quebec City and Atlanta all have two defunct or relocated teams with the Wanderers and Maroons, the Athletics and Nordiques, and the Flames and Thrashers, respectively. Philadelphia (Philadelphia Flyers), Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Penguins), and St. Louis (St. Louis Blues) gained teams during the 1967 expansion. After losing the Americans, two more teams have been added into the New York metropolitan area: the New York Islanders in 1972 and the New Jersey Devils in 1982. Other former host-metropolitan areas of NHL teams that have been given another team include: San Francisco Bay Area (San Jose Sharks in 1991), Ottawa (current Ottawa Senators in 1992), Denver (Colorado Avalanche in 1995), Minneapolis – St. Paul (Minnesota Wild in 2000) and Winnipeg (current Jets in 2011).</p>"	the national hockey league nhl is a professional mens ice hockey league founded

List of defunct and relocated Major League Baseball teams	<p> Throughout the history of Major League Baseball, numerous franchises have moved or become defunct. Many of these franchises played in the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), the two existing major leagues, but other franchises played in one of the eleven major leagues that ultimately went defunct. The classification of the major leagues is based on Major League Baseball's recognition of historical leagues. </p><p>Major league baseball emerged in the 1870s, and four major leagues, including the NL, played at least one season of baseball in the nineteenth century. During this period, dozens of franchises were founded, but most went defunct, leaving just twelve NL franchises by the 1892 season. After four of the twelve NL franchises went defunct following the 1899 season, the American League emerged in 1901 with several newly founded franchises. The Federal League (FL) challenged the primacy of the American League and the National League for two seasons, but the FL and all of its franchises went defunct after the 1915 season. Numerous Negro leagues operated during the first half of the twentieth century; seven leagues that operated from 1920 to 1948 were later recognized as major leagues by Major League Baseball. </p><p>Outside of the Negro leagues, no major league franchises relocated for several years after 1915, until the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee following the 1952 season. Several teams relocated over the next twenty years, often moving to the Western or Southern United States. After a period of over thirty years with no relocation, the Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005. </p>	throughout the history of major league baseball numerous franchises have moved or become defunct many of these franchises played in the national league nl and the american league al the two existing major leagues but other franchises played in one of the eleven major leagues that ultimately went defunct the classification of the major leagues is based on major league baseballs recognition of historical leagues major league baseball emerged in the 1870s and four major leagues including the nl played at least one season of baseball in the nineteenth century during this period dozens of franchises were founded but most went defunct leaving just twelve nl franchises by the 1892 season after four of the twelve nl franchises went defunct following the 1899 season the american league emerged in 1901 with several newly founded franchises the federal league fl challenged the primacy of the american league and the national league for two seasons but the fl and all of its franchises went defunct after the 1915 season numerous negro leagues operated during the first half of the twentieth century seven leagues that operated from 1920 to 1948 were later recognized as major leagues by major league baseball outside of the negro leagues no major league franchises relocated for several years after 1915 until the boston braves moved to milwaukee following the 1952 season several teams relocated over the next twenty years often moving to the western or southern united states after a period of over thirty years with no relocation the montreal expos became the washington nationals in 2005	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sports_teams

FC Arsenal Kyiv	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Football Club Arsenal Kyiv </b> (Ukrainian: <span lang=""uk"">Футбо́льний Клуб Арсена́л–Київ</span>) is a Ukrainian football club based in Kyiv.

Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Wimbledon Football Club relocated to Milton Keynes in September 2003, 16 months after receiving permission to do so from the Football Association on the basis of a two-to-one decision in favour by an FA-appointed independent commission. The move took the team from south London, where it had been based since its foundation in 1889, to Milton Keynes, a new town in Buckinghamshire, about 56 miles (90 km) to the northwest of the club's traditional home district Wimbledon. Hugely controversial, the move's authorisation prompted disaffected Wimbledon supporters to form AFC Wimbledon, a new club, in June 2002. The relocated team played home matches in Milton Keynes under the Wimbledon name from September 2003 until June 2004, when following the end of the 2003–04 season it renamed itself Milton Keynes Dons F.C. (MK Dons). </p><p>Wimbledon F.C. spent most of its history in non-League football before being elected to the Football League in 1977. A series of club owners believed that its long-term potential was limited by its home ground at Plough Lane, which never changed significantly from the team's non-League days. Meanwhile, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation envisaged a stadium in the town hosting top-flight football and was keen on the idea of an established League team relocating there. The Wimbledon chairman Ron Noades briefly explored moving Wimbledon to Milton Keynes in 1979, but decided it would not lead to larger crowds. Charlton Athletic briefly mooted a relocation in 1973, and in the 1980s the Milton Keynes Development Corporation offered a new ground to Luton Town, who almost became ""MK Hatters"". </p><p>Wimbledon rose through the professional divisions unusually rapidly in what has been called a ""fairytale"". By 1986, they had reached the First Division, the top-flight of English football. In 1991, after the Taylor Report ordered the redevelopment of English football grounds, the team entered a groundshare at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park stadium, about 6 miles (9.7 km) east of Plough Lane. This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while the Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam sought a new stadium site in south-west London, but this search proved frustratingly long, both for Hammam and the club's fans. Much to the anger of most Wimbledon supporters, Hammam proposed new locations for the team outside London, including the Irish capital Dublin. He sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, in 1997 and the following year sold Plough Lane for a supermarket redevelopment. </p><p>Starting in 1997 a consortium led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium, and offered this site to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended to relocate to Milton Keynes. Koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business. After the League refused permission, Koppel launched an appeal, leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently the appointment of a three-man independent commission by the FA in May 2002 to make a final and binding verdict. The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one. The vast majority of the team's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest. Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards. In June 2003 the club went into administration; Winkelman's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, where the team played its first match in September 2003. Winkelman's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name, badge and colours. The team's new ground, Stadium MK, opened three years later. MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C.'s heritage and history, but officially renounced this in 2007. AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015, which they eventually moved into ahead of the 2020–21 season.</p>"	wimbledon football club relocated to milton keynes in september 2003 16 months after receiving permission to do so from the football association on the basis of a twotoone decision in favour by an faappointed independent commission the move took the team from south london where it had been based since its foundation in 1889 to milton keynes a new town in buckinghamshire about 56 miles 90 km to the northwest of the clubs traditional home district wimbledon hugely controversial the moves authorisation prompted disaffected wimbledon supporters to form afc wimbledon a new club in june 2002 the relocated team played home matches in milton keynes under the wimbledon name from september 2003 until june 2004 when following the end of the 2003–04 season it renamed itself milton keynes dons fc mk dons wimbledon fc spent most of its history in nonleague football before being elected to the football league in 1977 a series of club owners believed that its longterm potential was limited by its home ground at plough lane which never changed significantly from the teams nonleague days meanwhile the milton keynes development corporation envisaged a stadium in the town hosting topflight football and was keen on the idea of an established league team relocating there the wimbledon chairman ron noades briefly explored moving wimbledon to milton keynes in 1979 but decided it would not lead to larger crowds charlton athletic briefly mooted a relocation in 1973 and in the 1980s the milton keynes development corporation offered a new ground to luton town who almost became mk hatters wimbledon rose through the professional divisions unusually rapidly in what has been called a fairytale by 1986 they had reached the first division the topflight of english football in 1991 after the taylor report ordered the redevelopment of english football grounds the team entered a groundshare at crystal palaces selhurst park stadium about 6 miles 97 km east of plough lane this was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while the wimbledon chairman sam hammam sought a new stadium site in southwest london but this search proved frustratingly long both for hammam and the clubs fans much to the anger of most wimbledon supporters hammam proposed new locations for the team outside london including the irish capital dublin he sold the club to two norwegian businessmen kjell inge røkke and bjørn rune gjelsten in 1997 and the following year sold plough lane for a supermarket redevelopment starting in 1997 a consortium led by pete winkelman proposed a large retail development in milton keynes including a football leaguestandard stadium and offered this site to luton wimbledon barnet crystal palace and queens park rangers røkke and gjelsten appointed a new chairman charles koppel who announced on 2 august 2001 that wimbledon intended to relocate to milton keynes koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business after the league refused permission koppel launched an appeal leading to an fa arbitration hearing and subsequently the appointment of a threeman independent commission by the fa in may 2002 to make a final and binding verdict the league and fa stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour two to one the vast majority of the teams fans switched allegiance to afc wimbledon in protest wimbledon fcs relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in milton keynes meeting football league standards in june 2003 the club went into administration winkelmans consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the national hockey stadium in milton keynes where the team played its first match in september 2003 winkelmans inter mk group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name badge and colours the teams new ground stadium mk opened three years later mk dons initially claimed wimbledon fcs heritage and history but officially renounced this in 2007 afc wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on plough lane in 2015 which they eventually moved into ahead of the 2020–21 season	Sports relocation	sports relocation	Sports_teams

Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s–1960s	<p> The <b>Major League Baseball relocations of the 1950s–1960s</b> brought several Major League Baseball franchises to the Western and Southern United States, expanding the league's geographical reach. This was in stark contrast to the early years of modern baseball, when the American League placed teams in National League cities. Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis had two teams; New York City had three. With no teams west of St. Louis or south of Washington, D.C., baseball was effectively confined to the Northeast and Midwest. </p><p>The moves, though controversial in some circles, brought new prosperity to the game of baseball. As of 2022, Chicago remains as the only market with two pre-expansion era teams, the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox, though the White Sox have several times come close to moving. </p><p>Baseball's expansion mirrored the westward movement of the U.S. population during a flourishing postwar economy that saw the arrival of commercial jet travel. Economic push and pull factors caused many teams to move, and the emergence of cities in the new frontier allowed baseball teams to pop up across the country. The moves of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants to California in 1958 opened the West Coast to the market of baseball. </p><p>Since 1960, the National and American Leagues have added 14 teams.</p>	the major league baseball relocations of the 1950s–1960s brought several major league baseball franchises to the western and southern united states expanding the leagues geographical reach this was in stark contrast to the early years of modern baseball when the american league placed teams in national league cities chicago boston philadelphia and st louis had two teams new york city had three with no teams west of st louis or south of washington dc baseball was effectively confined to the northeast and midwest the moves though controversial in some circles brought new prosperity to the game of baseball as of 2022 chicago remains as the only market with two preexpansion era teams the chicago cubs and the chicago white sox though the white sox have several times come close to moving baseballs expansion mirrored the westward movement of the us population during a flourishing postwar economy that saw the arrival of commercial jet travel economic push and pull factors caused many teams to move and the emergence of cities in the new frontier allowed baseball teams to pop up across the country the moves of the brooklyn dodgers and new york giants to california in 1958 opened the west coast to the market of baseball since 1960 the national and american leagues have added 14 teams	1959 senators	1959 senators	Sports_teams

Thames Valley Royals proposal	"<p>The <b>Thames Valley Royals proposal</b> was a controversial and ultimately unsuccessful 1983 proposal to merge the Oxford United Football Club with nearby team Reading. </p><p>Shortly before the end of the 1982–83 Football League season, Robert Maxwell, the then-owner and chairman of Oxford United Football Club, announced that he had made a deal with the owners of nearby Reading to amalgamate the two teams to create a new club he proposed to name ""Thames Valley Royals"". This appellation combined a loose term for the geographical region, ""Thames Valley"", with the Reading team's nickname, ""the Royals"". With each team having financial problems, Maxwell claimed that both were on the verge of going out of business and that uniting them was necessary for the region to retain a Football League club. </p><p>Maxwell envisioned Thames Valley Royals' future home as an unspecified location somewhere between Oxford and Reading where a new stadium would be built, perhaps Didcot; home matches would alternate between Oxford and Reading in the meantime.

Maxwell pressed on with his plan regardless, insisting that ""nothing short of the end of the Earth"" would prevent its fruition. </p><p>The proposed amalgamation was stopped by the actions of one of Reading's board directors, Roy Tranter, and Roger Smee, a businessman and former Reading player. Smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in Reading held by the faction of three Reading board members that backed the merger plan, including the chairman Frank Waller, and Tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 April 1983. Waller and his boardroom allies resigned under pressure from the rest of the Reading board on 12 May 1983, and at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in July, Smee took over the club, ending the amalgamation plans. </p>"	the thames valley royals proposal was a controversial and ultimately unsuccessful 1983 proposal to merge the oxford united football club with nearby team reading shortly before the end of the 1982–83 football league season robert maxwell the thenowner and chairman of oxford united football club announced that he had made a deal with the owners of nearby reading to amalgamate the two teams to create a new club he proposed to name thames valley royals this appellation combined a loose term for the geographical region thames valley with the reading teams nickname the royals with each team having financial problems maxwell claimed that both were on the verge of going out of business and that uniting them was necessary for the region to retain a football league club maxwell envisioned thames valley royals future home as an unspecified location somewhere between oxford and reading where a new stadium would be built perhaps didcot home matches would alternate between oxford and reading in the meantime both sets of supporters promptly embarked on mass demonstrations against the merger including protest marches and a 2000man sitin on the pitch at oxford before a match on 23 april maxwell pressed on with his plan regardless insisting that nothing short of the end of the earth would prevent its fruition the proposed amalgamation was stopped by the actions of one of readings board directors roy tranter and roger smee a businessman and former reading player smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in reading held by the faction of three reading board members that backed the merger plan including the chairman frank waller and tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 april 1983 waller and his boardroom allies resigned under pressure from the rest of the reading board on 12 may 1983 and at an extraordinary shareholders meeting in july smee took over the club ending the amalgamation plans	unsuccessful proposal to merge football teams	unsuccessful proposal to merge football teams	Sports_teams

With 38% market share, it is the most popular energy drink brand as of 2019. Since its launch in 1987, more than 82 billion cans of Red Bull have been sold worldwide, including 7.9 billion in 2020.</p><p>Originally available only in a single nondescript flavor sold in a tall and slim blue-silver can, called <b>Red Bull Energy Drink</b>, numerous variants of the drink were added over the course of time. Its slogan, ""Red Bull Gives You Wings"", is one of the most popular and memorable advertising slogans in the United States. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a ""brand myth"" through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project. In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships; celebrity endorsements; and music, through its Red Bull Records label.</p><p>Red Bull traces its origins to a similar drink called Krating Daeng, which was introduced in 1976 in Thailand by the pharmacist Chaleo Yoovidhya. Yoovidhya marketed his drink towards labourers and students pitching his product as a means to increase their productivity. He also advertised Krating Daeng in various Thai sporting events such as Muay Thai, which boosted its popularity. While doing business in Thailand, Dietrich Mateschitz purchased a can of Krating Daeng and claimed it cured his jet lag. Mateschitz sought to create a partnership with Yoovidhya and formulated a product that would suit the tastes of Westerners, such as carbonating the product. In 1984 the two founded Red Bull GmbH in 1984 in Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria. When branding their new product Mateschitz referenced Krating Daeng's name as in Thai, <i>daeng</i> means red, and a <i>krating</i> (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild bovine native to the Indian subcontinent. In 1987, the company sold its first can of Red Bull in Europe. In 1996 Red Bull began operation in the United States and has seen steady growth ever since. Both Red Bull and Kraeting Daeng use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market their drinks separately in the Thai and Western markets.

History of the West Indian cricket team	"<p>The <b>history of the West Indian cricket team</b> begins in the 1880s when the first combined West Indian team was formed and toured Canada and the United States. In the 1890s, the first representative sides were selected to play visiting English sides. Administered by the West Indies Cricket Board (""WICB""), and known colloquially as <i><b>The Windies</b></i>, the West Indies cricket team represents a sporting confederation of English-speaking Caribbean countries. </p><p>The WICB joined the sport's international ruling body, the Imperial Cricket Conference, in 1926, and played their first official international match, which in cricket is called a Test, in 1928. Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test nation, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s, by which time the side had changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side. By the late 1970s, the West Indies had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a title they retained throughout the 1980s. Their team from the 1970s and 1980s is now widely regarded as having been one of the best in test cricket's history, alongside Don Bradman's Invincibles. During these glory years, the Windies were noted for their four-man fast bowling attack, backed up by some of the best batsmen in the world. The 1980s saw them set a then-record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984, which was part of a still-standing record of 27 tests without defeat (the other tests being draws), as well as inflicting two 5–0 ""blackwashes"" against the old enemy of England. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, in part due to the rise in popularity of athletics and football in West Indian countries, and the team today is struggling to regain its past glory.</p><p>In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies of the West Indies Federation plus British Guyana. The current side represents the now independent states of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago, and the British dependencies of Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands along with the U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Maarten. National teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites. These national teams take part in the West Indian first-class competition, the Stanford 20/20, the Carib Beer Cup (earlier known as the <i>Busta Cup</i>, <i>Shell Shield</i> and various other names).

From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet. </p><p>India won its first World Cup in 1983, under the captaincy of Kapil Dev.

List of highest-paid Major League Baseball players	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The highest-paid player in Major League Baseball (MLB) from the 2018 Major League Baseball season is Los Angeles Angels' Center Fielder Mike Trout with an annual salary of $35.54 million on a 12-year contract for $426,500,000. MLB does not have a hard salary cap, instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season. Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $856,850 ($17,356,541 inflation-adjusted from 1934 dollars) over his entire playing career. When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($1,297,689 inflation-adjusted), while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, ""What the hell has Hoover got to do with it? Besides, I had a better year than he did.""</p><p>Alex Rodriguez has signed two record-breaking contracts over the course of his career. First, he signed a $252 million, 10-year contract with the Texas Rangers in December 2000 ($396,528,696 inflation-adjusted from 2000 dollars). Sandy Alderson called the deal ""stupefying"", while <i>Sports Illustrated</i> noted that Rodriguez's early salaries under the contract ($21 million) would be greater than the annual payroll of the entire Minnesota Twins team that year ($15.8 million). The deal was the largest sports contract in history, doubling the total value of Kevin Garnett's $126 million National Basketball Association contract (the previous record holder) and more than doubling Mike Hampton's $121 million contract, the previous MLB record which had been signed just days before. The Rangers later traded Rodriguez to the Yankees in exchange for Alfonso Soriano before the 2004 season, though they agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million outstanding on the contract. Despite this, he opted out of the remainder of his deal after the 2007 season and renegotiated a new $275 million, 10-year agreement with the Yankees, breaking his own record for the largest sports contract. Under this deal, Rodriguez also received $6 million when he tied the career home run total of Willie Mays (660), and would have received $6 million more had he tied Babe Ruth (714), Hank Aaron (755), and Barry Bonds (762), along with another $6 million for breaking Bonds' mark.</p><p>First base was the highest-paid position in 2010; regular starters at that position earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average of $3,014,572. Pitcher Nolan Ryan was the first player to earn an annual salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the Houston Astros in 1979. Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989, in 1990 Jose Canseco signed for 5 years and $23.5 million, making him the first player to earn an average of $4 million a year. It was until 2010 when the MLB average salary rose above that same mark. Five of the twenty highest-paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB.</p>"	the highestpaid player in major league baseball mlb from the 2018 major league baseball season is los angeles angels center fielder mike trout with an annual salary of 3554 million on a 12year contract for 426500000 mlb does not have a hard salary cap instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season free agency did not exist in mlb prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries babe ruth widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever earned an estimated 856850 17356541 inflationadjusted from 1934 dollars over his entire playing career when asked whether he thought he deserved to earn 80000 a year 1297689 inflationadjusted while the president herbert hoover had a 75000 salary ruth famously remarked what the hell has hoover got to do with it besides i had a better year than he didalex rodriguez has signed two recordbreaking contracts over the course of his career first he signed a 252 million 10year contract with the texas rangers in december 2000 396528696 inflationadjusted from 2000 dollars sandy alderson called the deal stupefying while sports illustrated noted that rodriguezs early salaries under the contract 21 million would be greater than the annual payroll of the entire minnesota twins team that year 158 million the deal was the largest sports contract in history doubling the total value of kevin garnetts 126 million national basketball association contract the previous record holder and more than doubling mike hamptons 121 million contract the previous mlb record which had been signed just days before the rangers later traded rodriguez to the yankees in exchange for alfonso soriano before the 2004 season though they agreed to pay 67 million of the 179 million outstanding on the contract despite this he opted out of the remainder of his deal after the 2007 season and renegotiated a new 275 million 10year agreement with the yankees breaking his own record for the largest sports contract under this deal rodriguez also received 6 million when he tied the career home run total of willie mays 660 and would have received 6 million more had he tied babe ruth 714 hank aaron 755 and barry bonds 762 along with another 6 million for breaking bonds markfirst base was the highestpaid position in 2010 regular starters at that position earned an average salary of 9504165 in compared to an overall average of 3014572 pitcher nolan ryan was the first player to earn an annual salary above 1 million signing a 45 million 4year contract with the houston astros in 1979 kirby puckett and rickey henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of 3 million a year in november 1989 in 1990 jose canseco signed for 5 years and 235 million making him the first player to earn an average of 4 million a year it was until 2010 when the mlb average salary rose above that same mark five of the twenty highestpaid players in 2013 were members of the yankees their team payroll for 2013 was 228835490 roughly 12 million above the secondlargest los angeles dodgers the yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll with some claiming it undermines the parity of mlb	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sportspeople
NBA salary cap	<p>The <b>NBA salary cap</b> is the limit to the total amount of money that National Basketball Association teams are allowed to pay their players. Like many professional sports leagues, the NBA has a salary cap to control costs and benefit parity, defined by the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA). This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions and is calculated as a percentage of the league's revenue from the previous season. Under the CBA ratified in July 2017, the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues. For the 2019–20 season, the cap is set at $109.14 million.</p><p>The majority of American leagues (NFL, NHL, MLS) have hard caps while the NBA has a soft salary cap. Hard salary caps forbid teams from going above the salary cap. Soft salary caps allow teams to go above the salary cap, but will subject such teams to reduced privileges in free agency. Teams that go above the luxury tax cap are subject to the luxury tax (a tax on every dollar spent over the luxury tax cap). </p>	the nba salary cap is the limit to the total amount of money that national basketball association teams are allowed to pay their players like many professional sports leagues the nba has a salary cap to control costs and benefit parity defined by the leagues collective bargaining agreement cba this limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions and is calculated as a percentage of the leagues revenue from the previous season under the cba ratified in july 2017 the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues for the 2019–20 season the cap is set at 10914 millionthe majority of american leagues nfl nhl mls have hard caps while the nba has a soft salary cap hard salary caps forbid teams from going above the salary cap soft salary caps allow teams to go above the salary cap but will subject such teams to reduced privileges in free agency teams that go above the luxury tax cap are subject to the luxury tax a tax on every dollar spent over the luxury tax cap	two way contract	two way contract	Sportspeople
Most valuable player	"<p>In sports, a <b>most valuable player</b> award is an honor typically bestowed upon an individual as the most performing player (or players) in an entire league, for a particular competition, or on a specific team. Initially used in professional sports, the term is now also commonly used in amateur sports, as well as in other unrelated fields such as media, business,, music and multiplayer video games. In many sports, MVP awards are presented for a specific match—in other words, a player of the match award. This is particularly true for high profile matches like championship games. </p><p>The term is most common in the United States and Canada. In most other countries around the world, ""player of the year"" is used for a season-spanning award and ""player of the match"" for individual games. In Australia, Australian rules football clubs and leagues use the term ""best and fairest"", while those playing rugby league use ""player of the year"", such as the Dally M Medal. The National Basketball League, however, uses the American-style ""MVP"" for its awards.</p><p>In many cases the awards are voted on by members of the media.

Don Gallinger	"<p><b>Donald Calvin Gallinger</b> (April 16, 1925 — February 3, 2000) was a Canadian ice hockey player who played 222 games in the National Hockey League with the Boston Bruins between 1942 and 1948. Born in Port Colborne, Gallinger was one of the league's youngest players when he broke into the NHL, playing on the ""Sprout Line"" of Boston with Bill Shill and Bep Guidolin. Gallinger's career was cut short, when in 1948 Gallinger and former team-mate Billy Taylor were discovered gambling on their own teams and banned for life by the NHL. They were reinstated in 1970 and these are the longest suspensions in NHL history. Prior to the suspension, Gallinger had established himself an effective offensive NHL player and, as an excellent multi-sport athlete, had even been sought after to play professional baseball. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1361 Cached time: 20220514104815 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [] CPU time usage: 0.180 seconds Real time usage: 0.237 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 870/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 9488/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 805/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 18/100 Expensive parser function count: 0/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 751/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.096/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3195589/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 214.062 1 -total 60.03% 128.496 1 Template:Infobox_ice_hockey_player 56.34% 120.600 1 Template:Infobox3cols 39.92% 85.446 1 Template:Short_description 24.35% 52.120 2 Template:Br_separated_entries 21.47% 45.950 1 Template:Pagetype 14.39% 30.805 1 Template:Birth_date 12.40% 26.535 2 Template:Convert 9.64% 20.632 4 Template:Main_other 8.08% 17.286 1 Template:SDcat -->"	donald calvin gallinger april 16 1925 — february 3 2000 was a canadian ice hockey player who played 222 games in the national hockey league with the boston bruins between 1942 and 1948 born in port colborne gallinger was one of the leagues youngest players when he broke into the nhl playing on the sprout line of boston with bill shill and bep guidolin gallingers career was cut short when in 1948 gallinger and former teammate billy taylor were discovered gambling on their own teams and banned for life by the nhl they were reinstated in 1970 and these are the longest suspensions in nhl history prior to the suspension gallinger had established himself an effective offensive nhl player and as an excellent multisport athlete had even been sought after to play professional baseball	Canadian ice hockey player (1925-2000)	canadian ice hockey player 19252000	Sportspeople

Association football and politics	<p> <b>Association football and politics</b> are connected in club identities, clashes, and footballers who choose a career in politics. Association football has played a role in maintaining the differences which give each European country a distinct identity, while strengthening the bonds that bind Europe together. According to Macon Benoit, European football underwent a massive transformation during the World War II era (1933–45). The game's sharp rise in popularity came at a time of high political intensity, leading to football's politicization. Benoit writes that during this period, European football began to embody four main characteristics: 1) an agent of international relations, in the sense that the foreign policies of European nations became articulated in matches; 2) a source of political propaganda, as football was used to build national pride and establish the legitimacy of political movements; 3) a tool for social pacification; football gave people a place to focus their energy that was not political, and 4) an avenue for protest; mass gatherings at matches gave spectators a forum for the expression of identity and political sentiments. European football stadiums have assumed other roles as places of refuge and sites of political uprisings and terrorist attacks. As European politics and relations have changed, football has remained a global means of political expression.</p><p>Three former footballers have led their countries: Ahmed Ben Bella, George Weah, and Kaj Leo Johannesen. Ben Bella played briefly for Marseille during the mid-1940s before leading Algeria in the aftermath of its war, first as prime minister and then as president. Weah, who played football for 18 years in Africa and Europe, was an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberian presidency in 2005 before his election in 2017. Johannesen, who played in goal four times for the Faroe Islands national football team during the 1990s, became prime minister of the Faroe Islands in 2008. Other footballers who have sought high political office include Albert Guðmundsson (who finished third in the 1980 Icelandic presidential election) and Oleg Malyshkin, who finished fifth in the 2004 Russian presidential elections. </p>	association football and politics are connected in club identities clashes and footballers who choose a career in politics association football has played a role in maintaining the differences which give each european country a distinct identity while strengthening the bonds that bind europe together according to macon benoit european football underwent a massive transformation during the world war ii era 1933–45 the games sharp rise in popularity came at a time of high political intensity leading to footballs politicization benoit writes that during this period european football began to embody four main characteristics 1 an agent of international relations in the sense that the foreign policies of european nations became articulated in matches 2 a source of political propaganda as football was used to build national pride and establish the legitimacy of political movements 3 a tool for social pacification football gave people a place to focus their energy that was not political and 4 an avenue for protest mass gatherings at matches gave spectators a forum for the expression of identity and political sentiments european football stadiums have assumed other roles as places of refuge and sites of political uprisings and terrorist attacks as european politics and relations have changed football has remained a global means of political expressionthree former footballers have led their countries ahmed ben bella george weah and kaj leo johannesen ben bella played briefly for marseille during the mid1940s before leading algeria in the aftermath of its war first as prime minister and then as president weah who played football for 18 years in africa and europe was an unsuccessful candidate for the liberian presidency in 2005 before his election in 2017 johannesen who played in goal four times for the faroe islands national football team during the 1990s became prime minister of the faroe islands in 2008 other footballers who have sought high political office include albert guðmundsson who finished third in the 1980 icelandic presidential election and oleg malyshkin who finished fifth in the 2004 russian presidential elections	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sportspeople

He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales, for whom he scored 11 goals and won two British Home Championship titles. His favoured position was outside right, and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a toothpick during games made him instantly recognisable. </p><p>In 27 seasons in the Football League from 1892 to 1924 (not including the four seasons lost to the First World War and the 1905–06 season in which he was banned for bribing an opposition player), he scored 194 goals in 740 league and cup appearances. He played for Chirk, before joining Northwich Victoria in 1892. His career took off when he signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895. He captained the team to the club's first major honour, a 1–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the 1904 FA Cup Final. He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing Aston Villa half-back Alex Leake £10 to lose a match. There he won the league title in 1907–08 and 1910–11, the FA Cup in 1909, as well as two FA Charity Shields. He also helped to set up the Players' Union, which was a fore-runner of the Professional Footballers' Association. He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at the age of 47 and played a further 32 games before retiring in 1924, making him the oldest ever player for City, United and Wales.

Stephen Lee (snooker player)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Stephen Lee</b> (born 12 October 1974) is an English professional snooker player who is currently banned from the world snooker tour. He turned professional in 1992 and was ranked in the top 16 between the 1997/1998 and 2007/2008 snooker seasons, reaching a career-high of fifth in the rankings. He won five ranking titles, reached the semi-finals of the 2003 World Championship and the final of the 2008 Masters. Thereafter, his form declined and he dropped out of the top 16 after the 2007/2008 season, meaning he would no longer automatically qualify for tournaments. A return to form in the 2011–12 season saw Lee win a fifth ranking title and regain his top 16 seeding. Lee is a strong break-builder, compiling 184 competitive century breaks during his career.

List of cricketers banned for corruption	<p> In cricket, match fixing occurs as a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. In particular, players have been approached by bookmakers and bribed to throw matches or aspects of matches (such as the toss), or provide other essential information. Fixing has happened in both international - including Test matches and One Day Internationals - and domestic cricket. The ban is issued by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's governing body, or by the respective cricket board(s) to which the player belongs. A ban may be for match fixing or spot-fixing. Both are misdemeanours banned under the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct. </p>	in cricket match fixing occurs as a match is played to a completely or partially predetermined result violating the rules of the game and often the law in particular players have been approached by bookmakers and bribed to throw matches or aspects of matches such as the toss or provide other essential information fixing has happened in both international including test matches and one day internationals and domestic cricket the ban is issued by the international cricket council icc the sports governing body or by the respective cricket boards to which the player belongs a ban may be for match fixing or spotfixing both are misdemeanours banned under the icc cricket code of conduct	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sportspeople

A banned person is forbidden from employment with MLB or its affiliated minor leagues, and is forbidden from other professional involvement with MLB such as acting as a sports agent for an MLB player.

Sudden cardiac death of athletes	<p>It remains a difficult medical challenge to prevent the <b>sudden cardiac death of athletes</b>, typically defined as natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms, excluding additional time on mechanical life support. (Wider definitions of sudden death are also in use, but not usually applied to the athletic situation.) Most causes relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease with no symptoms noted before the fatal event. The prevalence of any single, associated condition is low, probably less than 0.3% of the population in the athletes' age group, and the sensitivity and specificity of common screening tests leave much to be desired. The single most important predictor is fainting or near-fainting during exercise, which should require detailed explanation and investigation. The victims include many well-known names, especially in professional soccer, and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems. </p>	it remains a difficult medical challenge to prevent the sudden cardiac death of athletes typically defined as natural unexpected death from cardiac arrest within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms excluding additional time on mechanical life support wider definitions of sudden death are also in use but not usually applied to the athletic situation most causes relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease with no symptoms noted before the fatal event the prevalence of any single associated condition is low probably less than 03 of the population in the athletes age group and the sensitivity and specificity of common screening tests leave much to be desired the single most important predictor is fainting or nearfainting during exercise which should require detailed explanation and investigation the victims include many wellknown names especially in professional soccer and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems	natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest of athletes	natural unexpected death from cardiac arrest of athletes	Sportspeople

Paul Gascoigne	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Paul John Gascoigne</b> (<span></span>, born 27 May 1967), nicknamed <b>Gazza</b>, is an English former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He is described by the National Football Museum as ""widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation"".</p><p>Born and raised in Gateshead, Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with Newcastle United, before turning professional with the club in 1984. Three years later, he was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for £2.2 million. He won the FA Cup with Spurs in 1991, before being sold to Italian club Lazio for £5.5 million. In 1995, he was transferred to Rangers for £4.3 million and helped the club to two league titles, a Scottish Cup and a Scottish League Cup. He returned to England in a £3.4 million move to Middlesbrough in 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998–99 season, having already featured in the 1998 Football League Cup Final. He switched to Everton in 2000, and later had spells with Burnley, Gansu Tianma and Boston United. </p><p>Gascoigne represented the England national team from 1988 to 1998, in which he was capped 57 times and scored ten goals. He was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where he famously cried after receiving a yellow card in the semi-final with West Germany, which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of Euro 96, which included scoring a goal against Scotland, described in 2013 as ""one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history"". He has been involved in a number of high-profile goal celebrations at both club and international level, including the ""dentist's chair"" celebration from Euro 96, and mimicking playing the flute with Rangers in 1998, a reference to the Protestant Orange Order.</p><p>In the later part of his career, and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly alcoholism.

Commuting	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Commuting</b> is periodically recurring travel between one's place of residence and place of work or study, where the traveler, referred to as a <b>commuter</b>, leaves the boundary of their home community. By extension, it can sometimes be any regular or often repeated travel between locations, even when not work-related. The modes of travel, time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe. Most people in least-developed countries continue to walk to work, as the ancestors of all people did until the nineteenth century. The cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle, so this is common in low-income countries, but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental and health reasons. In middle-income countries, motorcycle commuting is very common. The next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location: in more populous, older cities, especially in Eurasia mass transit (rail, bus, etc.) predominates, while in smaller, younger cities, and large parts of North America and Australasia, communing by personal automobile is more common. A small number of very wealthy people, and those working in remote locations around the world, also commute by air travel, often for a week or more at a time rather the more typical daily commute. Transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions, allowing a distinction to arise between mostly-residential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city (process known as suburban sprawl), but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies, with Eurasian ""suburbs"" often being more densely populated than North American ""urban cores"". </p>"	commuting is periodically recurring travel between ones place of residence and place of work or study where the traveler referred to as a commuter leaves the boundary of their home community by extension it can sometimes be any regular or often repeated travel between locations even when not workrelated the modes of travel time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe most people in leastdeveloped countries continue to walk to work as the ancestors of all people did until the nineteenth century the cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle so this is common in lowincome countries but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental and health reasons in middleincome countries motorcycle commuting is very common the next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location in more populous older cities especially in eurasia mass transit rail bus etc predominates while in smaller younger cities and large parts of north america and australasia communing by personal automobile is more common a small number of very wealthy people and those working in remote locations around the world also commute by air travel often for a week or more at a time rather the more typical daily commute transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions allowing a distinction to arise between mostlyresidential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city process known as suburban sprawl but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies with eurasian suburbs often being more densely populated than north american urban cores	periodically recurring travel between one's place of residence and place of work, or study	periodically recurring travel between ones place of residence and place of work or study	Transport

Intermodal passenger transport	<p><b>Intermodal passenger transport</b>, also called <b>mixed-mode commuting</b>, involves using two or more modes of transportation in a journey. Mixed-mode commuting is often used to combine the strengths (and offset the weaknesses) of various transportation options. A major goal of modern intermodal passenger transport is to reduce dependence on the automobile as the major mode of ground transportation and increase use of public transport. To assist the traveller various intermodal journey planners such as Rome2rio and Google Transit have been devised to help travellers to plan and schedule their journey. </p><p>Mixed-mode commuting often centers on one type of rapid transit, such as regional rail, to which low-speed options (i.e. bus, tram, or bicycle) are appended at the beginning or end of the journey. Trains offer quick transit from a suburb into an urban area, where passengers can choose a way to complete the trip. Most transportation modes have always been used intermodally; for example, people have used road or urban railway to an airport or inter-regional railway station. </p>	intermodal passenger transport also called mixedmode commuting involves using two or more modes of transportation in a journey mixedmode commuting is often used to combine the strengths and offset the weaknesses of various transportation options a major goal of modern intermodal passenger transport is to reduce dependence on the automobile as the major mode of ground transportation and increase use of public transport to assist the traveller various intermodal journey planners such as rome2rio and google transit have been devised to help travellers to plan and schedule their journey mixedmode commuting often centers on one type of rapid transit such as regional rail to which lowspeed options ie bus tram or bicycle are appended at the beginning or end of the journey trains offer quick transit from a suburb into an urban area where passengers can choose a way to complete the trip most transportation modes have always been used intermodally for example people have used road or urban railway to an airport or interregional railway station	use of two or more modes of transportation in a journey	use of two or more modes of transportation in a journey	Transport

Super commuter	"<p>A <b>super commuter</b> is a person who works in the central county or downtown core of a metropolitan area and resides outside that metropolitan area.</p><p>In some metropolitan areas, costs of living are inhibitive to middle- and lower-income workers. As a result, some choose to live in more affordable metropolitan areas that are separate from the metropolitan area in which they work. Super commuters travel long distances, either daily, or once or twice a week between home and workplace either by air, rail, bus, and sometimes also by car, or a combination of modes.<sup class=""reference nowrap"">: <span title=""Page: 1 Quotation : &quot;And that has given Stockton one of the nation's highest concentrations of &quot;extreme commuters&quot; who travel 90 or more minutes to work. Long commutes are, of course, not unique to Northern California. The number of commuters who travel 90 or more minutes to work is almost 3 percent nationwide. But the phenomenon is even more evident in the Bay Area, where the numbers rose to nearly 5 percent from 3 percent in just three years, according to an analysis of census data by the Brookings Institution. In Stockton, 8 percent of commuters travel 90 minutes or more.&quot;"">1</span> </sup> Often, super commuters spend most of the work week in the city their office is based, returning home on weekends. </p><p>Super commuters are generally younger in age than average workers, and tend to be from a middle class background. They are not elite business travellers; they try to cut their costs by taking benefit of higher wages in one region and lower housing and transportation costs in the more affordable metropolitan area in which they reside. </p><p>A 2012 study by New York University's Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management showed that Manhattan alone has existing population of 59,000 super commuters. According to studies conducted in NYU there is great upsurge in this trend and 8 out of 10 of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S show similar findings. </p><p>Some super commuters reside and work in separate metropolitan areas due to their relationships in which both partners are employed.

Reverse commute	<p>A <b>reverse commute</b> is a round trip, regularly taken, from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning, and returning in the evening. It is almost universally applied to trips to work in the suburbs from homes in the city. This is in opposition to the regular commute, where a person lives in the suburbs and travels to work in the city. </p><p>The reverse commuter travels in the opposite direction of the regular daily traffic flow during rush hour, and therefore encounters less road traffic congestion faced by regular commuters. An advantage of this system is the usage of otherwise empty transit capacity: no additional trains or travel lanes are necessary to accommodate people riding or driving from downtown to the outskirts in the morning, and likewise back downtown at night. Train and bus routes may be more sparse in the reverse direction, but the vehicles have to get back somehow for their next journey in most cases. However, track capacity on some railroads (for example, the Long Island Rail Road in the suburbs of New York City) significantly reduces or even eliminates reverse commute options. Hence, transit usage can be lower for reverse-commuters than regular commuters. In some cases, reverse commuting has become quite popular. For example, Metro-North Railroad runs rush hour New Haven Line trains from New York City to Stamford, CT and surrounding suburbs to accommodate its many reverse commuters. Low unemployment rates in the suburbs may help to fuel the increase over the past years in reverse commuter ridership.</p><p>However, the very reasons commuting makes sense (such as higher employment in the city and lower housing prices in the suburbs) operate against the reverse commuter, so people doing so are less common compared to those going the other way. However, these traditional schools of thought are changing, especially in Southern and Western US cities, where employment options tend to follow a more decentralized or polycentric model than Midwest or Eastern US cities. For instance, on the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles, there are more vehicles in the morning peak hour heading westbound towards Santa Monica than into Downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>An example of reverse commuting can be found in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Due to a combination of ample transit infrastructure and the height limit in downtown, employment options in the area follow a polycentric model, heavily focused in both Downtown and areas such as Arlington, Tysons, Bethesda, and Silver Spring. Companies desiring space in Washington often opt for space in Maryland or Virginia because of the great expense of office space downtown. As such, there are many people who live in Washington and work in Maryland and Virginia, either driving, taking Metrobus, Metrorail, or carpooling.</p><p>A significant amount of reverse commuting occurs in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many workers live in San Francisco and work in job centers in Silicon Valley such as Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Cupertino. As of 2013, ridership on Caltrain during peak hours consisted of about 60% traditional commuters and 40% reverse commuters.</p>	a reverse commute is a round trip regularly taken from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning and returning in the evening it is almost universally applied to trips to work in the suburbs from homes in the city this is in opposition to the regular commute where a person lives in the suburbs and travels to work in the city the reverse commuter travels in the opposite direction of the regular daily traffic flow during rush hour and therefore encounters less road traffic congestion faced by regular commuters an advantage of this system is the usage of otherwise empty transit capacity no additional trains or travel lanes are necessary to accommodate people riding or driving from downtown to the outskirts in the morning and likewise back downtown at night train and bus routes may be more sparse in the reverse direction but the vehicles have to get back somehow for their next journey in most cases however track capacity on some railroads for example the long island rail road in the suburbs of new york city significantly reduces or even eliminates reverse commute options hence transit usage can be lower for reversecommuters than regular commuters in some cases reverse commuting has become quite popular for example metronorth railroad runs rush hour new haven line trains from new york city to stamford ct and surrounding suburbs to accommodate its many reverse commuters low unemployment rates in the suburbs may help to fuel the increase over the past years in reverse commuter ridershiphowever the very reasons commuting makes sense such as higher employment in the city and lower housing prices in the suburbs operate against the reverse commuter so people doing so are less common compared to those going the other way however these traditional schools of thought are changing especially in southern and western us cities where employment options tend to follow a more decentralized or polycentric model than midwest or eastern us cities for instance on the santa monica freeway in los angeles there are more vehicles in the morning peak hour heading westbound towards santa monica than into downtown los angelesan example of reverse commuting can be found in the washington metropolitan area due to a combination of ample transit infrastructure and the height limit in downtown employment options in the area follow a polycentric model heavily focused in both downtown and areas such as arlington tysons bethesda and silver spring companies desiring space in washington often opt for space in maryland or virginia because of the great expense of office space downtown as such there are many people who live in washington and work in maryland and virginia either driving taking metrobus metrorail or carpoolinga significant amount of reverse commuting occurs in the san francisco bay area where many workers live in san francisco and work in job centers in silicon valley such as palo alto mountain view and cupertino as of 2013 ridership on caltrain during peak hours consisted of about 60 traditional commuters and 40 reverse commuters	round trip from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning, and returning in the evening	round trip from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning and returning in the evening	Transport
Cross border commuters in the Berlin area 1948–1961	<p>The problem with <b>cross-border commuters</b> (German, <i>Grenzgänger</i>) in the Berlin area was a result of the political separation of East- and West Berlin in the years of 1948 and 1949.

Another cause was the difference is residential and industrial areas throughout Berlin, with the western districts being more prosperous. The Socialist Unity Party (SED), which governed East Berlin, used the matter of cross-border commuters in its propaganda, citing them as a problem, which helped them to justify the construction of the Berlin Wall, starting in August 1961. </p>	the problem with crossborder commuters german grenzgänger in the berlin area was a result of the political separation of east and west berlin in the years of 1948 and 1949 it resulted from the affiliations of the municipalities to two different currencies east berlin districts would use the east german mark mark der ddr and west berlin districts would use the german mark dm another cause was the difference is residential and industrial areas throughout berlin with the western districts being more prosperous the socialist unity party sed which governed east berlin used the matter of crossborder commuters in its propaganda citing them as a problem which helped them to justify the construction of the berlin wall starting in august 1961	Politics	politics	Transport

Metrocargo is a concept of intermodal shipment based on horizontal loading and unloading containers and swap bodies on standard flatbed wagons under the overhead electric feeding line. The system being fully automated and very efficient, it is time and cost effective for the distributed intermodal transport over a territory and for processing full trains in port to dry port shuttling. The promoters constructed a full-scale prototype unit and the EC-funded research pro-ject VIT Vision for Innovative Transport successfully researched the remaining technical issues. This MIT <b>Metrocargo Intermodal Transport</b> project is about bringing Metrocargo from research to market stage and promoting its dissemination among logistic decision-makers throughout Europe. Technically, MIT will implement specific technical improvements and the scaling up from single prototypal unit to full industrial installation, developing typical plant design and SW applications to automate and optimise the work flow and provide interfaces with operators and external systems. Promotion and dissemination will be the main goal, carrying out market studies in several EU member states and subsequent market plans to exploit the Metrocargo features in terms of installation and operating costs, limited use of dock area, safety and environmental impact. Economic advantages to operators in typical situations will be deter-mined effecting specific feasibility studies. Dissemination events will be organised centred on the full scale Metrocargo prototype installed in the port of Vado Ligure. The SMEs will exhibit the system in main logistic and transport shows in Europe and will organise road-show presentations in several countries, using videos and a dynamic simulation SW tool to illustrate the solutions for specific needs. At the end of this Project the Metrocargo technology will be a fully developed market-ready system that will be widely known among European logistic decision makers. </p>"	mit metrocargo intermodal transport is a project partly funded by the european union under the programme “ research for the benefit of smes “ – call id “ fp7sme2011 ” and managed by research executive agency metrocargo is a concept of intermodal shipment based on horizontal loading and unloading containers and swap bodies on standard flatbed wagons under the overhead electric feeding line the system being fully automated and very efficient it is time and cost effective for the distributed intermodal transport over a territory and for processing full trains in port to dry port shuttling the promoters constructed a fullscale prototype unit and the ecfunded research project vit vision for innovative transport successfully researched the remaining technical issues this mit metrocargo intermodal transport project is about bringing metrocargo from research to market stage and promoting its dissemination among logistic decisionmakers throughout europe technically mit will implement specific technical improvements and the scaling up from single prototypal unit to full industrial installation developing typical plant design and sw applications to automate and optimise the work flow and provide interfaces with operators and external systems promotion and dissemination will be the main goal carrying out market studies in several eu member states and subsequent market plans to exploit the metrocargo features in terms of installation and operating costs limited use of dock area safety and environmental impact economic advantages to operators in typical situations will be determined effecting specific feasibility studies dissemination events will be organised centred on the full scale metrocargo prototype installed in the port of vado ligure the smes will exhibit the system in main logistic and transport shows in europe and will organise roadshow presentations in several countries using videos and a dynamic simulation sw tool to illustrate the solutions for specific needs at the end of this project the metrocargo technology will be a fully developed marketready system that will be widely known among european logistic decision makers	European Project partly founded by the EC	european project partly founded by the ec	Transport

In North America, the loading gauge is often high enough to accommodate double stack containers, so the height of a semi-trailer on a flatcar is no issue. However, in Europe, except for purpose built lines such as the Channel Tunnel or the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the loading gauge height is much smaller, and it is necessary to transport the trailers with the tires about 30 cm (11.81 in) above the rails, so the trailers cannot be simply parked on the surface of a flat car above the wagon wheels or bogies. Making the wagon wheels smaller limits the maximum speed, so many designs allow the trailer to be transported with its wheels lower than the rail wagon wheels. An early approach in France was the <i>Kangourou wagon</i> with modified trailers. This technology did not survive, due to the market resistance to modified trailers. Today, three designs for these special wagons are in commercial service, ""Modalohr"", ""CargoBeamer"" and ""Niederflurwagen"" . </p><p>During a rolling-highway journey, if the drivers accompany the trailer, they are accommodated in a passenger car or a sleeping car.

The modes of travel, time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe. Most people in least-developed countries continue to walk to work, as the ancestors of all people did until the nineteenth century. The cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle, so this is common in low-income countries, but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental and health reasons. In middle-income countries, motorcycle commuting is very common. The next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location: in more populous, older cities, especially in Eurasia mass transit (rail, bus, etc.) predominates, while in smaller, younger cities, and large parts of North America and Australasia, communing by personal automobile is more common. A small number of very wealthy people, and those working in remote locations around the world, also commute by air travel, often for a week or more at a time rather the more typical daily commute. Transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions, allowing a distinction to arise between mostly-residential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city (process known as suburban sprawl), but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies, with Eurasian ""suburbs"" often being more densely populated than North American ""urban cores"". </p>"	commuting is periodically recurring travel between ones place of residence and place of work or study where the traveler referred to as a commuter leaves the boundary of their home community by extension it can sometimes be any regular or often repeated travel between locations even when not workrelated the modes of travel time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe most people in leastdeveloped countries continue to walk to work as the ancestors of all people did until the nineteenth century the cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle so this is common in lowincome countries but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental and health reasons in middleincome countries motorcycle commuting is very common the next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location in more populous older cities especially in eurasia mass transit rail bus etc predominates while in smaller younger cities and large parts of north america and australasia communing by personal automobile is more common a small number of very wealthy people and those working in remote locations around the world also commute by air travel often for a week or more at a time rather the more typical daily commute transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions allowing a distinction to arise between mostlyresidential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city process known as suburban sprawl but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies with eurasian suburbs often being more densely populated than north american urban cores	periodically recurring travel between one's place of residence and place of work, or study	periodically recurring travel between ones place of residence and place of work or study	Transport
Road ecology	<p><b>Road ecology</b> is the study of the ecological effects (both positive and negative) of roads and highways (public roads). These effects may include local effects, such as on noise, water pollution, habitat destruction/disturbance and local air quality; and the wider environmental effects of transport such as habitat fragmentation, ecosystem degradation, and climate change from vehicle emissions. </p><p>The design, construction and management of roads, parking and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of vehicles can change their effect. Roads are known to cause significant damage to forests, prairies, streams and wetlands. Besides the direct habitat loss due to the road itself, and the roadkill of animal species, roads alter water-flow patterns, increase noise, water, and air pollution, create disturbance that alters the species composition of nearby vegetation thereby reducing habitat for local native animals, and act as barriers to animal movements. Roads are a form of linear infrastructure intrusion that has some effects similar to infrastructure such as railroads, power lines, and canals, particularly in tropical forests.</p><p>Road ecology is practiced as a field of inquiry by a variety of ecologists, biologists, hydrologists, engineers, and other scientists. There are several global centers for the study of road ecology: 1) The Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis, which was the first of its kind in the world; 2) the Centro Brasileiro de Estudos em Ecologia de Estradas at the Federal University of Lavras, Brazil; 3) The Center for Transportation and the Environment, North Carolina State University; and 4) the Road Ecology Program at the Western Transportation Institute, Montana State University.

Interlining	"<p><b>Interlining</b>, also known as <b>interline ticketing</b> and <b>interline booking</b>, is a voluntary commercial agreement between individual airlines to handle passengers traveling on itineraries that require multiple flights on multiple airlines. Such agreements allow passengers to change from one flight on one airline to another flight on another airline without having to gather their bags or check-in again. Airlines can also promise free rebooking if the connection is lost due to a delay. </p><p>Interlining agreements differ from codeshare agreements in that codeshare agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline's code (abbreviation) even though the flight is operated by another airline. However, codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket (or e-ticket) can be issued, since both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare operating carrier must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued. </p><p>Interline agreements are directional. For example, it may be possible for American Airlines to issue the ticket on an American-United itinerary, but United might not be able to be issuer on the same itinerary. Such a one-directional interline agreement is called a unilateral interline. The airlines may also agree to enter a bilateral interline agreement, where each airline can issue the ticket on the other airline. </p><p>Previously, only large network carriers such as United Airlines and Lufthansa would have electronic ticket interline agreements, but the IATA mandate to eliminate paper tickets at the end of 2007 has changed this by forcing smaller carriers to implement electronic ticketing. </p><p>Smaller legacy carriers commonly have interline agreements with large network carriers that fly into their markets. Most newer low-cost airlines that only sell directly to consumers (and not through agencies or Global distribution systems) do not support interlining at all. </p><p>If no interline ticketing agreement exists, then two separate tickets will need to be issued, and passengers will have to retrieve their bags and carry it to the connecting airline for check-in. Itineraries with interline connections such as this are riskier for travelers, since the second carrier may be unaware of delays or issues with the incoming flight and is less likely to permit a rebooking without cost if the connection is lost. There can also be a problem if luggage is lost and the traveler wants it to be sent to them later. </p><p>Most online travel agencies will only display itineraries that can be ticketed on one of their booking systems. However, some ticket websites will sometimes display un-ticketable interline itineraries.

Flight cancellation and delay	<p>A <b>flight delay</b> is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time.

A <b>cancellation</b> occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason. </p><p>In the European Union, Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 states that flight delays for over three hours, cancellations and denied boarding entitles passengers to a compensation from €250 up to €600 per passenger from the airline.</p><p>In the United States, when flights are canceled or delayed, passengers may be entitled to compensation due to rules obeyed by every flight company, usually Rule 240, or Rule 218 in certain locations. This rule usually specifies that passengers may be entitled to certain reimbursements, including a free room if the next flight is the day after the canceled one, a choice of reimbursement, rerouting, phone calls, and refreshments. When a flight is delayed, the FAA allocates slots for takeoffs and landings based on which flight is scheduled first.

Freedom of movement under United States law	"<p> <b>Freedom of movement under United States law</b> is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, ""The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."" Since the circuit court ruling in <i>Corfield v. Coryell</i>, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In <i>Paul v.

However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement. Under the ""privileges and immunities"" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the court held consistently through the years in cases such as <i>Ward v.

Homesickness	<p><b>Homesickness</b> is the distress caused by being away from home. Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects. Sufferers typically report a combination of depressive and anxious symptoms, withdrawn behavior and difficulty focusing on topics unrelated to home.

Travel photography	<p><b>Travel photography</b> is a genre of photography that may involve the documentation of an area's landscape, people, cultures, customs, and history. The Photographic Society of America defines a travel photo as an image that expresses the feeling of a time and place, portrays a land, its people, or a culture in its natural state, and has no geographical limitations.</p><p>Travel photography as a genre is one of the most open in terms of the subjects it covers. Many travel photographers specialize in a particular aspect of photography such as travel portraits, landscape or documentary photography as well as shooting all aspects of travel. Much of today's Travel Photography style is derived from early work in Magazines such as National Geographic magazine from photographers such as Steve McCurry. This genre of photography entails shooting a wide variety of subjects under varied available conditions, e.g. low light photography indoors, available ambient light photography for exteriors of buildings and monuments, shooting on the streets where sometimes conditions may be hostile, capturing moments which rarely recur, capturing the magic of light while shooting landscapes, etc. </p><p>As travel has become more accessible, more and more, the genre is opening up to amateurs and professionals alike. Amateur Travel photography is often shared through sites like Flickr, 500px and 1x. Travel photography, unlike other genres like fashion, product, or food photography, is still an underestimated and relatively less monetized genre, though the challenges faced by travel photographers are a lot greater than some of the genres where the light and other shooting conditions may be controllable. Traditionally travel photographers earned money through Stock photography, magazine assignments, and commercial projects. Nowadays, the stock photography market has collapsed and more and more photographers are using more innovative methods of earning a living such as through blogging, public speaking, commercial projects, and teaching. </p>	travel photography is a genre of photography that may involve the documentation of an areas landscape people cultures customs and history the photographic society of america defines a travel photo as an image that expresses the feeling of a time and place portrays a land its people or a culture in its natural state and has no geographical limitationstravel photography as a genre is one of the most open in terms of the subjects it covers many travel photographers specialize in a particular aspect of photography such as travel portraits landscape or documentary photography as well as shooting all aspects of travel much of todays travel photography style is derived from early work in magazines such as national geographic magazine from photographers such as steve mccurry this genre of photography entails shooting a wide variety of subjects under varied available conditions eg low light photography indoors available ambient light photography for exteriors of buildings and monuments shooting on the streets where sometimes conditions may be hostile capturing moments which rarely recur capturing the magic of light while shooting landscapes etc as travel has become more accessible more and more the genre is opening up to amateurs and professionals alike amateur travel photography is often shared through sites like flickr 500px and 1x travel photography unlike other genres like fashion product or food photography is still an underestimated and relatively less monetized genre though the challenges faced by travel photographers are a lot greater than some of the genres where the light and other shooting conditions may be controllable traditionally travel photographers earned money through stock photography magazine assignments and commercial projects nowadays the stock photography market has collapsed and more and more photographers are using more innovative methods of earning a living such as through blogging public speaking commercial projects and teaching	photography genre	photography genre	Transport
Travelers' diarrhea	"<p><b>Travelers' diarrhea</b> (<b>TD</b>) is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed stool (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling. It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, headache and bloating. Occasionally bloody diarrhea may occur. Most travelers recover within three to four days with little or no treatment. About 10% of people may have symptoms for a week.</p><p>Bacteria are responsible for more than half of cases. The bacteria enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) are typically the most common except in Southeast Asia, where <i>Campylobacter</i> is more prominent. About 10 to 20 percent of cases are due to norovirus. Protozoa such as <i>Giardia</i> may cause longer term disease. The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults. People affected are more often from the developed world.</p><p>Recommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food, drinking bottled water, and frequent hand washing. The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for cholera, is of questionable use for travelers' diarrhea. Preventive antibiotics are generally discouraged. Primary treatment includes rehydration and replacing lost salts (oral rehydration therapy). Antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms, and can be taken with loperamide to decrease diarrhea. Hospitalization is required in less than 3 percent of cases.</p><p>Estimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50 percent among travelers to the developing world. TD is particularly common among people traveling to Asia (except for Japan and Singapore), the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. The risk is moderate in Southern Europe, Russia, and China. TD has been linked to later irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain–Barré syndrome. It has colloquially been known by a number of names, including ""Montezuma's revenge,"" the ""Nile runs"" and ""Delhi belly"".</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1374 Cached time: 20220514124024 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.444 seconds Real time usage: 0.522 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1079/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 29654/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1828/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 9/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 20917/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.252/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5678685/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 467.726 1 -total 29.80% 139.378 2 Template:Cite_book 20.55% 96.097 2 Template:Short_description 19.67% 91.981 1 Template:Infobox_medical_condition_(new) 15.04% 70.359 1 Template:Infobox 8.73% 40.849 2 Template:Pagetype 8.41% 39.327 1 Template:Redirect2 6.88% 32.166 4 Template:Cite_journal 6.87% 32.115 6 Template:Main_other 5.61% 26.241 3 Template:Cite_web -->"	travelers diarrhea td is a stomach and intestinal infection td is defined as the passage of unformed stool one or more by some definitions three or more by others while traveling it may be accompanied by abdominal cramps nausea fever headache and bloating occasionally bloody diarrhea may occur most travelers recover within three to four days with little or no treatment about 10 of people may have symptoms for a weekbacteria are responsible for more than half of cases the bacteria enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec are typically the most common except in southeast asia where campylobacter is more prominent about 10 to 20 percent of cases are due to norovirus protozoa such as giardia may cause longer term disease the risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults people affected are more often from the developed worldrecommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food drinking bottled water and frequent hand washing the oral cholera vaccine while effective for cholera is of questionable use for travelers diarrhea preventive antibiotics are generally discouraged primary treatment includes rehydration and replacing lost salts oral rehydration therapy antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms and can be taken with loperamide to decrease diarrhea hospitalization is required in less than 3 percent of casesestimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50 percent among travelers to the developing world td is particularly common among people traveling to asia except for japan and singapore the middle east africa mexico and central and south america the risk is moderate in southern europe russia and china td has been linked to later irritable bowel syndrome and guillain–barré syndrome it has colloquially been known by a number of names including montezumas revenge the nile runs and delhi belly	disease	disease	Transport

This includes the MTA's rapid transit systems, the New York City Subway and Staten Island Railway, and its commuter rail services, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and Metro-North Railroad. Consequently, most stations were not designed to be accessible to people with disabilities, and many MTA facilities lack accessible announcements, signs, tactile components, and other features. </p><p>A city law, the New York City Human Rights Law, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.

New Urbanism	"<p><b>New Urbanism</b> is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighbourhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types.

New urbanism attempts to address the ills associated with urban sprawl and post-Second World War suburban development.</p><p>New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood development (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD). These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.</p> <p>The organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the <i>Charter of the New Urbanism</i>, which begins: </p> <blockquote class=""templatequote""><p>We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, ecology, and building practice.</p></blockquote> <p>New Urbanists support regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl. The <i>Charter of the New Urbanism</i> also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the re-development of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for New Urbanist approaches. </p><p>Architecturally, New Urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern, or vernacular styles, although that is not always the case.

Freight exchange	<p>A <b>freight exchange</b> is an online service for haulage companies, logistics providers, freight forwarders, transport companies and (in some cases) private customers. It allows haulage companies to search a database of available freight that needs to be delivered and advertise their available vehicle capacity. Logistics providers and freight forwarders can advertise their freight loads that need delivering and also match their freight loads to the available vehicle capacity. These systems provide a platform that allows carriers to communicate freight traffic information to fellow operators such as transporters, forwarders and logistics companies. They allow forwarders to advertise their freight either privately or publicly to a large number of freight operators that are looking for loads. They also allow freight operators to offer vehicle space. Online systems are often subscription-based with a small charge for advertising (posting) and searching (consulting). Some freight exchanges operate without monthly fees. They charge transport providers only a success fee, which is payable when the quote is accepted. </p><p>The main purpose of a freight exchange is to fill empty vehicles on their return journeys (when they are on their way back to their depot after a delivery) by matching them to available freight. </p><p>For example, a trucker has an order to transport tulips from Keukenhof in the Netherlands to Como, Italy. Ideally, a freight order for the return trip would increase profitability, so the trucker would search for return freight or return load on a freight exchange. </p><p>Finding return loads results in improved efficiency for haulage and transport companies as well as helping cut down on empty journeys, which reduces CO2 emissions. Transport is responsible for 25% of global emissions of greenhouse gases (including CO2) in the European Union. Around 24% of road freight journeys in the UK were empty in 2019.</p><p>The world's first electronic freight exchange was called Teleroute and was launched in France on the Minitel system in 1985.

Public transport	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Public transport</b> (also known as <b>public transportation</b>, <b>public transit</b>, <b>mass transit</b>, or simply <b>transit</b>) is a system of transport for passengers by group travel systems available for use by the general public unlike private transport, typically managed on a schedule, operated on established routes, and that charge a posted fee for each trip. There is no rigid definition; the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> specifies that public transportation is within urban areas, and air travel is often not thought of when discussing public transport—dictionaries use wording like ""buses, trains, etc."" Examples of public transport include city buses, trolleybuses, trams (or light rail) and passenger trains, rapid transit (metro/subway/underground, etc.) and ferries. Public transport between cities is dominated by airlines, coaches, and intercity rail. High-speed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world. </p><p>Most public transport systems run along fixed routes with set embarkation/disembarkation points to a prearranged timetable, with the most frequent services running to a headway (e.g.: ""every 15 minutes"" as opposed to being scheduled for any specific time of the day). However, most public transport trips include other modes of travel, such as passengers walking or catching bus services to access train stations. Share taxis offer on-demand services in many parts of the world, which may compete with fixed public transport lines, or complement them, by bringing passengers to interchanges. Paratransit is sometimes used in areas of low demand and for people who need a door-to-door service.</p><p>Urban public transit differs distinctly among Asia, North America, and Europe. In Asia, profit-driven, privately owned and publicly traded mass transit and real estate conglomerates predominantly operate public transit systems. In North America, municipal transit authorities most commonly run mass transit operations. In Europe, both state-owned and private companies predominantly operate mass transit systems. </p><p>For geographical, historical and economic reasons, differences exist internationally regarding use and extent of public transport. While countries in the Old World tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities, many cities of the New World have more sprawl and much less comprehensive public transport. The International Association of Public Transport (UITP) is the international network for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry. It has 3,400 members from 92 countries from all over the globe. </p><p>In recent years, some high-wealth cities have seen a decline in public transport usage. A number of sources attribute this trend to the rise in popularity of remote work, ride-sharing services, and car loans being relatively cheap across many countries. Major cities such as Toronto, Paris, Chicago, and London have seen this decline and have attempted to intervene by cutting fares and encouraging new modes of transportation, such as e-scooters and e-bikes. Because of the reduced emissions and other environmental impacts of using public transportation over private transportation, many experts have pointed to an increased investment in public transit as an important climate change mitigation tactic.</p>"	public transport also known as public transportation public transit mass transit or simply transit is a system of transport for passengers by group travel systems available for use by the general public unlike private transport typically managed on a schedule operated on established routes and that charge a posted fee for each trip there is no rigid definition the encyclopædia britannica specifies that public transportation is within urban areas and air travel is often not thought of when discussing public transport—dictionaries use wording like buses trains etc examples of public transport include city buses trolleybuses trams or light rail and passenger trains rapid transit metrosubwayunderground etc and ferries public transport between cities is dominated by airlines coaches and intercity rail highspeed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world most public transport systems run along fixed routes with set embarkationdisembarkation points to a prearranged timetable with the most frequent services running to a headway eg every 15 minutes as opposed to being scheduled for any specific time of the day however most public transport trips include other modes of travel such as passengers walking or catching bus services to access train stations share taxis offer ondemand services in many parts of the world which may compete with fixed public transport lines or complement them by bringing passengers to interchanges paratransit is sometimes used in areas of low demand and for people who need a doortodoor serviceurban public transit differs distinctly among asia north america and europe in asia profitdriven privately owned and publicly traded mass transit and real estate conglomerates predominantly operate public transit systems in north america municipal transit authorities most commonly run mass transit operations in europe both stateowned and private companies predominantly operate mass transit systems for geographical historical and economic reasons differences exist internationally regarding use and extent of public transport while countries in the old world tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities many cities of the new world have more sprawl and much less comprehensive public transport the international association of public transport uitp is the international network for public transport authorities and operators policy decisionmakers scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry it has 3400 members from 92 countries from all over the globe in recent years some highwealth cities have seen a decline in public transport usage a number of sources attribute this trend to the rise in popularity of remote work ridesharing services and car loans being relatively cheap across many countries major cities such as toronto paris chicago and london have seen this decline and have attempted to intervene by cutting fares and encouraging new modes of transportation such as escooters and ebikes because of the reduced emissions and other environmental impacts of using public transportation over private transportation many experts have pointed to an increased investment in public transit as an important climate change mitigation tactic	shared transportation service for use by the general public with fixed route or schedule	shared transportation service for use by the general public with fixed route or schedule	Transport

Living street	<p>A <b>living street</b> is a street designed in the interests of pedestrians and cyclists. Living streets also act as social spaces, allowing children to play and encouraging social interactions on a human scale, safely and legally. These roads are still available for use by motor vehicles, however their design aims to reduce both the speed and dominance of motorised transport. This is often achieved using the shared space approach, with greatly reduced demarcations between vehicle traffic and pedestrians. Vehicle parking may also be restricted to designated bays. These street design principles first became popularized in the Netherlands during the 1970s, and the Dutch word <i>woonerf</i> (lit. residential grounds) is often used as a synonym for living street. </p>	a living street is a street designed in the interests of pedestrians and cyclists living streets also act as social spaces allowing children to play and encouraging social interactions on a human scale safely and legally these roads are still available for use by motor vehicles however their design aims to reduce both the speed and dominance of motorised transport this is often achieved using the shared space approach with greatly reduced demarcations between vehicle traffic and pedestrians vehicle parking may also be restricted to designated bays these street design principles first became popularized in the netherlands during the 1970s and the dutch word woonerf lit residential grounds is often used as a synonym for living street	street designed as a social space for pedestrians and cyclists, motorized transport is permitted, but limited	street designed as a social space for pedestrians and cyclists motorized transport is permitted but limited	Transport
Sustainable transport	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1045330069""><p><b>Sustainable transport</b> refers to ways of transportation that are sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system. Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector. Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog.</p><p>Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility, with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options. The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose. Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimization.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided. Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon, a component of particulate matter, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change. The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better air quality.</p><p>The social costs of transport include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity, time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people's time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services. Traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion. Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant, livable, sustainable cities. </p>"	sustainable transport refers to ways of transportation that are sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road water or air transport the source of energy and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport roads railways airways waterways canals and terminals transport operations and logistics as well as transitoriented development are also involved in evaluation transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system transport systems have significant impacts on the environment accounting for between 20 and 25 of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions the majority of the emissions almost 97 came from direct burning of fossil fuels greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smogsustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options the advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental social and economic costs that transport systems pose shortterm activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while longterm goals include migrating transportation from fossilbased energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources the entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimizationthe united nations environment programme unep estimates that each year 24 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon a component of particulate matter which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change the links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change and by improving public health through better air qualitythe social costs of transport include road crashes air pollution physical inactivity time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting peoples time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility especially for vehicles and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts but the real purpose of transport is access – to work education goods and services friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts and managing traffic congestion communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant livable sustainable cities	broad subject of transport that is sustainable in the senses of social, environmental and climate impacts and the ability to, in the global scope, supply the source energy indefinitely	broad subject of transport that is sustainable in the senses of social environmental and climate impacts and the ability to in the global scope supply the source energy indefinitely	Transport
Road space rationing	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p><b>Road space rationing</b>, also known as <b>alternate-day travel</b>, <b>driving restriction</b> and <b>no-drive days</b> (Spanish: <i lang=""es"">restricción vehicular</i>; Portuguese: <i lang=""pt"">rodízio veicular</i>; French: <i lang=""fr"">circulation alternée</i>), is a travel demand management strategy aimed to reduce the negative externalities generated by urban air pollution or peak urban travel demand in excess of available supply or road capacity, through artificially restricting demand (vehicle travel) by rationing the scarce common good road capacity, especially during the peak periods or during peak pollution events. This objective is achieved by restricting traffic access into an urban cordon area, city center (CBD), or district based upon the last digits of the license number on pre-established days and during certain periods, usually, the peak hours. </p><p>The practical implementation of this traffic restraint policy is common in Latin America, and in many cases, the road rationing has as a main goal the reduction of air pollution, such as the cases of México City, and Santiago, Chile. São Paulo, with a fleet of 6 million vehicles in 2007, is the largest metropolis in the world with such a travel restriction, implemented first in 1996 as measured to mitigate air pollution, and thereafter made permanent in 1997 to relieve traffic congestion. More recent implementations in Costa Rica and Honduras have had the objective of reducing oil consumption, due to the high impact this import has on the economy of small countries, and considering the steep increases in oil prices that began in 2003. Bogotá, Quito, and La Paz, Bolivia also have similar driving restriction schemes in place. </p><p>After a temporary implementation of road space rationing to reduce air pollution in Beijing during the 2008 Summer Olympics, local officials put in place several permanent rationing schemes to improve the city's air quality.

Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion. These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).

Tram	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>tram</b> (also known as a <b>streetcar</b>, <b>tramcar</b>, <b>trolley</b> or <b>trolleycar</b> in North America) is a train that runs on a tramway track on public urban streets; some include segments on segregated right-of-way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars as public transport are called tramways or simply tram/streetcar. Many recently built tramways use the contemporary term light rail. The vehicles are called streetcars or trolleys (not to be confused with trolleybus) in North America and trams or tramcars elsewhere. The first two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States, with <i>trolley</i> being the preferred term in the eastern US and <i>streetcar</i> in the western US. <i>Streetcar</i> or <i>tramway</i> are preferred in Canada. In parts of the United States, internally powered buses made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as ""trolleys"". To avoid further confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as ""trolley-replica buses"". In the United States, the term <i>tram</i> has sometimes been used for rubber-tired trackless trains, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams. </p><p>Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than main line and rapid transit trains. Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a pantograph sliding on an overhead line; older systems may use a trolley pole or a bow collector. In some cases, a contact shoe on a third rail is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems—electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry freight. Trams are now commonly included in the wider term ""light rail"", which also includes grade-separated systems. Some trams, known as tram-trains, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to interurban systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features. </p><p>Ultra Light Rail ULR trains are trams are a developing light weight rail type, around &lt;5T/axle (empty), for use in smaller cities and towns to replace main bus routes eg. Coventry Very Light Rail, ULR Partners future-light-rail or lower use branch train lines. They may be normal trams, rail motor sized and/or smaller modular units capable of platooning. They offer all the advantages of traditional trams but their lower weight, prefabricated beam type tracks offer the possibility of avoiding costly services diversions, lightweight OHL Over Head Lines and/or onboard power options eg. hydrogen, biomethane, battery, may mean reduced/eliminated OHL. Thus installation costs may be lower than traditional trains and trams. </p><p>One of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low rolling resistance of metal wheels on steel rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort.

Smart growth	"<p><b>Smart growth</b> is an urban planning and transportation theory that concentrates growth in compact walkable urban centers to avoid sprawl. It also advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land use, including neighborhood schools, complete streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices. The term ""smart growth"" is particularly used in North America. In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms ""compact city"", ""urban densification"" or ""urban intensification"" have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries. </p><p>Smart growth values long-range, regional considerations of sustainability over a short-term focus.

These restrictions may be only imposed during peak travel times or may apply at all times. According to the criteria used there are different types of lanes: temporary or permanent with concrete barriers; two-directional or reversible; and exclusive, concurrent or contraflow lanes working in peak periods. The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll. HOV lanes are normally introduced to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, although their effectiveness is questionable.</p><p>Regional and corporate-sponsored vanpools, carpools, and rideshare communities give commuters a way to increase occupancy. For places without such services, online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose. Slugging lines are common in some places, where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow them to use the HOV lane. High-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes), which allow solo driver vehicles to use HOV lanes on payment of a fee which varies depending on demand, have also been introduced in the United States and Canada. </p>	a highoccupancy vehicle lane also known as an hov lane carpool lane diamond lane 2 lane and transit lane or t2 or t3 lanes is a restricted traffic lane reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers including carpools vanpools and transit buses these restrictions may be only imposed during peak travel times or may apply at all times according to the criteria used there are different types of lanes temporary or permanent with concrete barriers twodirectional or reversible and exclusive concurrent or contraflow lanes working in peak periods the normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles including motorcycles charter buses emergency and law enforcement vehicles lowemission and other green vehicles andor singleoccupancy vehicles paying a toll hov lanes are normally introduced to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution although their effectiveness is questionableregional and corporatesponsored vanpools carpools and rideshare communities give commuters a way to increase occupancy for places without such services online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose slugging lines are common in some places where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow them to use the hov lane highoccupancy toll lanes hot lanes which allow solo driver vehicles to use hov lanes on payment of a fee which varies depending on demand have also been introduced in the united states and canada	restricted traffic lane	restricted traffic lane	Transport
Electric vehicle	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>electric vehicle</b> (<b>EV</b>)<b></b> is an automotive vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. It can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or it can be powered autonomously by a battery (sometimes charged by solar panels, or by converting fuel to electricity using fuel cells or a generator). EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft. </p><p>EVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Internal combustion engines were the dominant propulsion method for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but electric power remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types. </p><p>In the 21st century, EVs have seen a resurgence due to technological developments, and an increased focus on renewable energy and the potential reduction of transportation's impact on climate change, air pollution, and other environmental issues. Project Drawdown describes electric vehicles as one of the 100 best contemporary solutions for addressing climate change.</p><p>Government incentives to increase adoption were first introduced in the late 2000s, including in the United States and the European Union, leading to a growing market for the vehicles in the 2010s. Increasing public interest and awareness and structural incentives, such as those being built into the green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to greatly increase the electric vehicle market. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have reduced the amount of greenhouse gases from gasoline or diesel vehicles. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that governments should do more to meet climate goals, including policies for heavy electric vehicles. Electric vehicle sales may increase from 2% of global share in 2016 to 30% by 2030. Much of this growth is expected in markets like North America, Europe and China; a 2020 literature review suggested that growth in use of electric 4-wheeled vehicles appears economically unlikely in developing economies, but that electric 2-wheeler growth is likely.

Induced demand	"<p><b>Induced demand</b> – related to <b>latent demand</b> and <b>generated demand</b> – is the phenomenon whereby an increase in supply results in a decline in price and an increase in consumption.

In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase 'sixth form college' as the English name for a lycée (Highschool).</p><p>In England and the Caribbean, education is currently compulsory until the end of Year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18.

Some places only provide tertiary colleges, a ""combination"" between sixth form and further education colleges. In the independent sector, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools (public schools), and there is also a number of smaller-scale independent sixth form colleges. In Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of year 11. </p><p>Students at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 12 and 13 – Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland – or lower sixth and upper sixth).

On 6 January, ABVP's joint secretary for Delhi, Anima Sonkar, admitted on television that two armed men seen in videos of the incident were members of ABVP. Although any one clear motive has not emerged, the attack has been described by some as a way to prevent students from raising their voice against a fee hike and the Citizenship Amendment Act.</p><p>Police have said that three of the masked attackers have been identified but no arrests have been made, and complaints have been filed as a single FIR (First Information Report) on unknown people.

Graduate school	"<p>A <b>graduate school</b> (sometimes shortened to <b>grad school</b>) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (e.g., master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, speech–language pathology, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa. </p><p>Many universities award graduate degrees; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution. While the term ""graduate school"" is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere (e.g., Canada), ""postgraduate education"" is also used in English-speaking countries (Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and the UK) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor's degree. Those attending graduate schools are called ""graduate students"" (in both American and British English), or often in British English as ""postgraduate students"" and, colloquially, ""postgraduates"" and ""postgrads"". Degrees awarded to graduate students include master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees. </p><p>Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. This research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation. In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training (e.g., MPA, MBA, MHA), the degrees may consist solely of coursework, without an original research or thesis component. The term ""graduate school"" is primarily North American. Additionally, in North America, the term does not usually refer to medical school (whose students are called ""medical students""), and only occasionally refers to law school or business school; these are often collectively termed professional schools. Graduate students in the humanities, sciences and social sciences often receive funding from the school (e.g., fellowships or scholarships) or a teaching assistant position or other job; in the profession-oriented grad programs, students are less likely to get funding, and the fees are typically much higher. </p><p>Although graduate school programs are distinct from undergraduate degree programs, graduate instruction (in the US, Australia, and other countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses. Unlike in undergraduate programs, however, it is less common for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level. At the Ph.D. level, though, it is quite common to take courses from a wider range of study, for which some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as a <i>residency</i>, is typically required to be taken from outside the department and college of the degree-seeking candidate, to broaden the research abilities of the student. </p>"	a graduate school sometimes shortened to grad school is a school that awards advanced academic degrees eg masters and doctoral degrees with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate bachelors degree a distinction is typically made between graduate schools where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession and professional schools which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine nursing business engineering speech–language pathology or law the distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa many universities award graduate degrees a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution while the term graduate school is typical in the united states and often used elsewhere eg canada postgraduate education is also used in englishspeaking countries australia bangladesh canada india ireland new zealand pakistan south africa and the uk to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelors degree those attending graduate schools are called graduate students in both american and british english or often in british english as postgraduate students and colloquially postgraduates and postgrads degrees awarded to graduate students include masters degrees doctoral degrees and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities natural sciences and social sciences this research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation in graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training eg mpa mba mha the degrees may consist solely of coursework without an original research or thesis component the term graduate school is primarily north american additionally in north america the term does not usually refer to medical school whose students are called medical students and only occasionally refers to law school or business school these are often collectively termed professional schools graduate students in the humanities sciences and social sciences often receive funding from the school eg fellowships or scholarships or a teaching assistant position or other job in the professionoriented grad programs students are less likely to get funding and the fees are typically much higher although graduate school programs are distinct from undergraduate degree programs graduate instruction in the us australia and other countries is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses unlike in undergraduate programs however it is less common for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level at the phd level though it is quite common to take courses from a wider range of study for which some fixed portion of coursework sometimes known as a residency is typically required to be taken from outside the department and college of the degreeseeking candidate to broaden the research abilities of the student	school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree	school that awards advanced academic degrees ie masters and doctoral degrees with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate bachelors degree	Universities_and_colleges

The school admitted that its admission process favored certain minority groups, but argued that there was a compelling state interest to ensure a ""critical mass"" of students from minority groups. In a majority opinion joined by four other justices, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor held that the Constitution ""does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."" </p><p>In her majority opinion, O'Connor wrote that ""race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time,"" adding that the ""Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment, but did not subscribe to the belief that the affirmative measures in question would be unnecessary in 25 years. In a dissent joined by three other justices, Chief Justice William Rehnquist argued that the university's admissions system was, in fact, a thinly veiled and unconstitutional quota system. </p><p>The decision largely upheld the Court's decision in <i>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</i> (1978), which allowed race to be a consideration in admissions policy but held racial quotas to be unconstitutional. In <i>Gratz v. Bollinger</i> (2003) a separate case decided on the same day as <i>Grutter</i>, the Court struck down a points-based admissions system that awarded an automatic bonus to the admissions scores of minority applicants. </p>"	grutter v bollinger 539 us 306 2003 was a landmark case of the supreme court of the united states concerning affirmative action in student admissions the court held that a student admissions process that favors underrepresented minority groups does not violate the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause so long as it takes into account other factors evaluated on an individual basis for every applicant the case arose after a prospective student to the university of michigan law school alleged that she had been denied admission because the school gave certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission the school admitted that its admission process favored certain minority groups but argued that there was a compelling state interest to ensure a critical mass of students from minority groups in a majority opinion joined by four other justices justice sandra day oconnor held that the constitution does not prohibit the law schools narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body in her majority opinion oconnor wrote that raceconscious admissions policies must be limited in time adding that the court expects that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer concurred in the judgment but did not subscribe to the belief that the affirmative measures in question would be unnecessary in 25 years in a dissent joined by three other justices chief justice william rehnquist argued that the universitys admissions system was in fact a thinly veiled and unconstitutional quota system the decision largely upheld the courts decision in regents of the university of california v bakke 1978 which allowed race to be a consideration in admissions policy but held racial quotas to be unconstitutional in gratz v bollinger 2003 a separate case decided on the same day as grutter the court struck down a pointsbased admissions system that awarded an automatic bonus to the admissions scores of minority applicants	2003 United States Supreme Court case	2003 united states supreme court case	Universities_and_colleges
Regents of the University of California v. Bakke	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</b></i>, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy. However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, were impermissible. </p><p>Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved. Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, <i>DeFunis v. Odegaard</i> (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds. </p><p>Allan P. Bakke (<span></span>), an engineer and former Marine officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission due in part to his age. Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, and therefore considered too old by at least two institutions. After twice being rejected by the University of California, Davis, he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the school's affirmative action program. The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention. </p><p>The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. The practical effect of <i>Bakke</i> was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the <i>Bakke</i> case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i>. </p>"	regents of the university of california v bakke 438 us 265 1978 was a landmark decision by the supreme court of the united states it upheld affirmative action allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy however the court ruled that specific racial quotas such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the university of california davis school of medicine were impermissible although the supreme court had outlawed segregation in schools and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the us constitution an earlier case that the supreme court had taken in an attempt to address the issue defunis v odegaard 1974 was dismissed on procedural grounds allan p bakke an engineer and former marine officer sought admission to medical school but was rejected for admission due in part to his age bakke was in his early 30s while applying and therefore considered too old by at least two institutions after twice being rejected by the university of california davis he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the schools affirmative action program the california supreme court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered bakke admitted the us supreme court accepted the case amid wide public attention the case fractured the court the nine justices issued a total of six opinions the judgment of the court was written by justice lewis f powell jr two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of powells opinion finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the constitution and the title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 nevertheless uc daviss program went too far for a majority of justices and it was struck down and bakke admitted the practical effect of bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change questions about whether the bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld powells position in a majority opinion in grutter v bollinger	United States Supreme Court case	united states supreme court case	Universities_and_colleges

Wait list	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Wait list</b>, in university and college admissions, is a term used in the United States and other countries to describe a situation in which a college or university has not formally accepted a particular student for admission, but at the same time may offer admission in the next few months if spaces become available. It is a contingent offer only, and may mean an offer of admission in the future, or it may not, depending on circumstances. It has been described as a type of college admissions ""purgatory"", or being held in ""the higher-ed equivalent of limbo"". The percent of applicants offered admission, who decide to accept, is known as the <i>admissions yield</i>, and this proportion varies somewhat from year to year, and reflects economic conditions as well as interest in a given university. </p><p>Colleges mailing out wait list offers generally advise students to reserve a spot at a college they have been accepted to by sending in a deposit, usually several hundred dollars to guarantee that the student will have a place at any college in the fall. Later, if a student is accepted by a college from a wait list, and if he or she chooses to accept the wait list offer, it usually entails sacrificing that earlier deposit. In the United States, for students applying by regular admission, the month of April is a time when much activity happens; colleges email offers of acceptance and rejection, and students select a college by sending a deposit. In May, after receiving deposits, colleges know how many spots will be open, and will usually begin to offer admission to students on their wait lists as positions become open. Students can be offered admission from the wait list during May and June and throughout the summer. </p><p>According to several reports, colleges and universities use wait lists to try to hedge their guesses about how many students will ultimately decide to accept their offers of admission in any given academic year, with the idea being to build ""a reservoir of qualified students to draw from to replace successful applicants who choose to go elsewhere."" If fewer students say yes, then colleges will often go to their wait lists to try to find replacements. In 2010, according to one source, roughly 10% of college applicants were put on a wait list.</p><p>Wait lists tend to be used by elite and selective universities as well as second-tier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall; for example, Stanford and Yale put 1,000 students on their wait lists and Duke put 3,000 on their wait list, according to one report in 2010. Amherst takes 35 students from the 1,000 students on its wait list. And as a general rule, selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of wait list. Of the students on a wait list at a highly selective school, a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late August or September. One report said the fraction of wait-listed students who were eventually offered admission––as an average of all students wait listed in a given year––was 30%, but this is an overall average, and the fraction of wait-listed applicants to prestigious universities, who are eventually admitted, is much less. Students who are wait-listed can take steps to improve their chances of admission from a wait list by writing letters of interest and by sending second-semester senior grades. Wait listed students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability, based on the college's estimation of admissions criteria, and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open; this ranking is not revealed to the public. </p>"	wait list in university and college admissions is a term used in the united states and other countries to describe a situation in which a college or university has not formally accepted a particular student for admission but at the same time may offer admission in the next few months if spaces become available it is a contingent offer only and may mean an offer of admission in the future or it may not depending on circumstances it has been described as a type of college admissions purgatory or being held in the highered equivalent of limbo the percent of applicants offered admission who decide to accept is known as the admissions yield and this proportion varies somewhat from year to year and reflects economic conditions as well as interest in a given university colleges mailing out wait list offers generally advise students to reserve a spot at a college they have been accepted to by sending in a deposit usually several hundred dollars to guarantee that the student will have a place at any college in the fall later if a student is accepted by a college from a wait list and if he or she chooses to accept the wait list offer it usually entails sacrificing that earlier deposit in the united states for students applying by regular admission the month of april is a time when much activity happens colleges email offers of acceptance and rejection and students select a college by sending a deposit in may after receiving deposits colleges know how many spots will be open and will usually begin to offer admission to students on their wait lists as positions become open students can be offered admission from the wait list during may and june and throughout the summer according to several reports colleges and universities use wait lists to try to hedge their guesses about how many students will ultimately decide to accept their offers of admission in any given academic year with the idea being to build a reservoir of qualified students to draw from to replace successful applicants who choose to go elsewhere if fewer students say yes then colleges will often go to their wait lists to try to find replacements in 2010 according to one source roughly 10 of college applicants were put on a wait listwait lists tend to be used by elite and selective universities as well as secondtier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall for example stanford and yale put 1000 students on their wait lists and duke put 3000 on their wait list according to one report in 2010 amherst takes 35 students from the 1000 students on its wait list and as a general rule selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of wait list of the students on a wait list at a highly selective school a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late august or september one report said the fraction of waitlisted students who were eventually offered admission––as an average of all students wait listed in a given year––was 30 but this is an overall average and the fraction of waitlisted applicants to prestigious universities who are eventually admitted is much less students who are waitlisted can take steps to improve their chances of admission from a wait list by writing letters of interest and by sending secondsemester senior grades wait listed students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability based on the colleges estimation of admissions criteria and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open this ranking is not revealed to the public	college admission circumstance where an applicant has not been accepted but may be if room opens	college admission circumstance where an applicant has not been accepted but may be if room opens	Universities_and_colleges
Yield (college admissions)	<p><b>Yield</b> in college admissions is the percent of students who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission. It is calculated by dividing the number of students who choose to enroll at a school in a given year, which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit, by the total number of offers of acceptance sent. A higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education. The yield rate is usually calculated once per year based on admissions statistics. As a statistical measure, it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity, such that a higher yield rate is a sign of a more selective college. For example, the yield rate for Princeton University was 69% in 2016, while the yield rate for Dartmouth was 55%, and the yield rate for Colorado College was 37%. The yield rate has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs; in 2001, a report in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> by reporter Daniel Golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or wait list well-qualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll, as a way to boost the college's overall yield rate; according to the report, these actions are part of an effort to improve a college's scores on the US News college ranking. This practice is known as yield protection. </p>	yield in college admissions is the percent of students who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission it is calculated by dividing the number of students who choose to enroll at a school in a given year which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit by the total number of offers of acceptance sent a higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education the yield rate is usually calculated once per year based on admissions statistics as a statistical measure it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity such that a higher yield rate is a sign of a more selective college for example the yield rate for princeton university was 69 in 2016 while the yield rate for dartmouth was 55 and the yield rate for colorado college was 37 the yield rate has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs in 2001 a report in the wall street journal by reporter daniel golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or wait list wellqualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll as a way to boost the colleges overall yield rate according to the report these actions are part of an effort to improve a colleges scores on the us news college ranking this practice is known as yield protection	the percent of students who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission	the percent of students who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission	Universities_and_colleges

Early entrance to college	<p><b>Early entrance to college</b>, sometimes called <b>early admission</b> or <b>early enrollment</b>, is the practice of allowing high school students to be accelerated into college, one or more years before the traditional age of college entrance, and without obtaining a high school diploma. In some cases this is done individually. Often, however, it is done as part of a cohort acceleration program, in which many such students are accelerated into college together at the same time. These programs are usually targeted to gifted students, and may provide their students with a social support network and help in dealing with the adjustment. </p><p>By placing students into full-time college studies, early entrance differs from dual enrollment, early college high school, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced International Certificate of Education programs, which are alternative methods of earned college credits (or their equivalent) while in high school. </p><p>Early entrance programs take a number of forms. Some, like the Advanced Academy of Georgia and The Clarkson School, are special programs within larger colleges. In others, like the early entrance program at Shimer College, the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted at Mary Baldwin University, and the Early Entrance Program at CSULA, early entrants study side-by-side with traditional college students. Bard College at Simon's Rock is the only four-year college designed exclusively for younger students. Also, some colleges do allow some younger people who have early enrollment to take classes and be a part of the college community. </p>	early entrance to college sometimes called early admission or early enrollment is the practice of allowing high school students to be accelerated into college one or more years before the traditional age of college entrance and without obtaining a high school diploma in some cases this is done individually often however it is done as part of a cohort acceleration program in which many such students are accelerated into college together at the same time these programs are usually targeted to gifted students and may provide their students with a social support network and help in dealing with the adjustment by placing students into fulltime college studies early entrance differs from dual enrollment early college high school advanced placement international baccalaureate and advanced international certificate of education programs which are alternative methods of earned college credits or their equivalent while in high school early entrance programs take a number of forms some like the advanced academy of georgia and the clarkson school are special programs within larger colleges in others like the early entrance program at shimer college the program for the exceptionally gifted at mary baldwin university and the early entrance program at csula early entrants study sidebyside with traditional college students bard college at simons rock is the only fouryear college designed exclusively for younger students also some colleges do allow some younger people who have early enrollment to take classes and be a part of the college community	secondary school students entering full-time postsecondary education earlier than usual and without a secondary education diploma	secondary school students entering fulltime postsecondary education earlier than usual and without a secondary education diploma	Universities_and_colleges
DeFunis v. Odegaard	"<p><i><b>DeFunis v. Odegaard</b></i>, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the case had become moot and so declined to render a decision on the merits. American student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law in the state of Washington before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to graduate within a few months of the decision being rendered.</p><p>The Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the plaintiff. The case did not constitute ""voluntary cessation"" on the part of the defendant law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review. </p><p>DeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's affirmative action policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in <i>DeFunis</i>, the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in <i>Regents of the University of California v.

Widening participation	<p> <b>Widening participation</b> (<b>WP</b>) in higher education is a major component of government education policy in the United Kingdom and Europe. It consists of an attempt to increase not only the numbers of young people entering higher education, but also the proportion from under-represented groups (those from lower income families, people with disabilities and some ethnic minorities). </p><p>In this way it is hoped to redress the inequalities in participation between social classes. Widening participation is one of the strategic objectives of the Office for Students (OfS). The issue of widening participation became a political issue after the Laura Spence Affair which hit the headlines in 2000, and after the University of Bristol admissions controversy in 2003, which concerned alleged biases in favour of the state sector. </p><p>The Office for Students is pursuing this policy through a number of measures, including the payment of financial incentives to universities and by funding the Uni Connect programme. </p><p>This policy is linked to the previous Labour government's target of increasing participation in higher education to 50% by 2010. </p>	widening participation wp in higher education is a major component of government education policy in the united kingdom and europe it consists of an attempt to increase not only the numbers of young people entering higher education but also the proportion from underrepresented groups those from lower income families people with disabilities and some ethnic minorities in this way it is hoped to redress the inequalities in participation between social classes widening participation is one of the strategic objectives of the office for students ofs the issue of widening participation became a political issue after the laura spence affair which hit the headlines in 2000 and after the university of bristol admissions controversy in 2003 which concerned alleged biases in favour of the state sector the office for students is pursuing this policy through a number of measures including the payment of financial incentives to universities and by funding the uni connect programme this policy is linked to the previous labour governments target of increasing participation in higher education to 50 by 2010	efforts to broaden access to higher education	efforts to broaden access to higher education	Universities_and_colleges

Asian quota	"<p>An <b>Asian quota</b> is the claim that there is a racial quota limiting the number of people of Asian descent in an establishment, a special case of <i>numerus clausus</i>. It usually refers to alleged educational quotas in United States higher education admissions, specifically by Ivy League universities against Asian Americans, especially persons of East Asian and South Asian descent starting in the late 1980s. These allegations of discrimination have been denied by U.S. universities. Asian quotas have been compared to earlier claims of Jewish quotas, which are believed to limit the admissions of a model minority from the 1910s to the 1950s. Jewish quotas were denied at the time, but their existence is rarely disputed now. Some have thus called Asian-Americans ""The New Jews"" of university admissions.</p><p>Proponents of Asian quotas' existence believe that by various measures admissions have a bias against Asian applicants, though not necessarily a strict quota: for example, successful Asian applicants have on average higher test scores than the overall average. The perceived bias against applicants of Asian descent has been termed a ""bamboo ceiling"" or ""Asian penalty"". Alleged Asian quotas have been the subject of government investigations and lawsuits, with some minor conclusions of their existence, though no major judgements, as of 2017.</p>"	an asian quota is the claim that there is a racial quota limiting the number of people of asian descent in an establishment a special case of numerus clausus it usually refers to alleged educational quotas in united states higher education admissions specifically by ivy league universities against asian americans especially persons of east asian and south asian descent starting in the late 1980s these allegations of discrimination have been denied by us universities asian quotas have been compared to earlier claims of jewish quotas which are believed to limit the admissions of a model minority from the 1910s to the 1950s jewish quotas were denied at the time but their existence is rarely disputed now some have thus called asianamericans the new jews of university admissionsproponents of asian quotas existence believe that by various measures admissions have a bias against asian applicants though not necessarily a strict quota for example successful asian applicants have on average higher test scores than the overall average the perceived bias against applicants of asian descent has been termed a bamboo ceiling or asian penalty alleged asian quotas have been the subject of government investigations and lawsuits with some minor conclusions of their existence though no major judgements as of 2017	type of racial quota	type of racial quota	Universities_and_colleges
Early action	<p><b>Early action</b> (EA) is a type of early admission process offered by some institutions for admission to colleges and universities in the United States. Unlike the regular admissions process, EA usually requires students to submit an application by mid-October or early November of their senior year of high school instead of January 1. Students are notified of the school's decision by early January instead of mid-March or May 1. </p><p>In this way, it is similar to many colleges' Early Decision (ED) programs. Some colleges offer both ED and EA. ED, however, is a binding commitment to enroll; that is, if accepted under ED, the applicant must withdraw all other applications and enroll at that institution. Thus, ED does not allow applicants to apply to more than one ED school simultaneously. Early Action, on the other hand, allows candidates to decline the offer if accepted, and depending on the program, it <i>may</i> be possible for a candidate to apply to one or more EA schools, plus one ED school. EA can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school since a student will know the result of the application sooner, and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools.</p>	early action ea is a type of early admission process offered by some institutions for admission to colleges and universities in the united states unlike the regular admissions process ea usually requires students to submit an application by midoctober or early november of their senior year of high school instead of january 1 students are notified of the schools decision by early january instead of midmarch or may 1 in this way it is similar to many colleges early decision ed programs some colleges offer both ed and ea ed however is a binding commitment to enroll that is if accepted under ed the applicant must withdraw all other applications and enroll at that institution thus ed does not allow applicants to apply to more than one ed school simultaneously early action on the other hand allows candidates to decline the offer if accepted and depending on the program it may be possible for a candidate to apply to one or more ea schools plus one ed school ea can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school since a student will know the result of the application sooner and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools	type of university early admission process	type of university early admission process	Universities_and_colleges

Early decision	<p><b>Early decision</b> (<b>ED</b>) or <b>early acceptance</b> is a type of early admission used in college admissions in the United States for admitting freshmen to undergraduate programs. It is used to indicate to the university or college that the candidate considers that institution to be their top choice through a binding commitment to enroll (i.e., if offered admission under an ED program, and the financial aid offered by the school is acceptable, the candidate must enroll at that institution and withdraw all applications to other institutions). Applying early decision brings a greater statistical chance of being accepted. </p><p>Candidates applying early decision typically submit their applications mid-October to early November of their senior year of high school and receive a decision around mid-December. In contrast, students applying regular decision typically must submit their applications by January 1 and receive their admissions decision by April 1. Students can know sooner where they will attend, removing uncertainty and the need for multiple applications and the associated costs. </p><p>Typically, a candidate who has applied early decision can receive one of three outcomes in December. They may be admitted (bound to attend the school which admitted them), rejected (they will not be able to attend the school), or deferred (they will be reconsidered for admission with the second round of early decision applications or with the regular decision pool and notified later with their final decision).

Need-blind admission	<p><b>Need-blind admission</b> is a term used in the United States denoting a college admission policy in which an institution does not consider an applicant's financial situation when deciding admission. This policy generally increases the proportion of admitted students needing financial aid and often requires the institution to back the policy with an ample endowment or other sources of funding. Being need-blind is a statutory requirement for institutions to participate in an antitrust exemption granted by Congress which remains in effect until September 30, 2022. An institution may be need-blind in any given year by policy (de jure) or by circumstances (de facto). </p><p>Most colleges and universities cannot afford to offer adequate financial aid to all admitted students; some are not need-blind while others admit students on a need-blind basis but do not offer them sufficient aid to meet their full demonstrated financial need. In addition, many schools that admit domestic first-year students without regard to need do not extend this policy to international or transfer students. Schools that are need-blind and meet full need for all applicants are usually very selective as they tend to receive more applications than other schools. </p><p>Institutions set their own definition of meeting the full demonstrated need. There is no universal standard that an institution must abide by to claim that it meets full demonstrated need. Additionally, some institutions meet full demonstrated need entirely through grants, merit scholarships, and/or talent scholarships, whereas others include loans that need to be repaid and/or work-study directly at the college campus in addition to the other forms of financial aid. For these reasons, an admitted student's financial aid package can vary significantly at different schools that all claim to meet full demonstrated need. </p> 	needblind admission is a term used in the united states denoting a college admission policy in which an institution does not consider an applicants financial situation when deciding admission this policy generally increases the proportion of admitted students needing financial aid and often requires the institution to back the policy with an ample endowment or other sources of funding being needblind is a statutory requirement for institutions to participate in an antitrust exemption granted by congress which remains in effect until september 30 2022 an institution may be needblind in any given year by policy de jure or by circumstances de facto most colleges and universities can not afford to offer adequate financial aid to all admitted students some are not needblind while others admit students on a needblind basis but do not offer them sufficient aid to meet their full demonstrated financial need in addition many schools that admit domestic firstyear students without regard to need do not extend this policy to international or transfer students schools that are needblind and meet full need for all applicants are usually very selective as they tend to receive more applications than other schools institutions set their own definition of meeting the full demonstrated need there is no universal standard that an institution must abide by to claim that it meets full demonstrated need additionally some institutions meet full demonstrated need entirely through grants merit scholarships andor talent scholarships whereas others include loans that need to be repaid andor workstudy directly at the college campus in addition to the other forms of financial aid for these reasons an admitted students financial aid package can vary significantly at different schools that all claim to meet full demonstrated need	College admission policy	college admission policy	Universities_and_colleges
Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</b></i>, 572 U.S. 291 (2014), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning affirmative action and race- and sex-based discrimination in public university admissions. In a 6-2 decision, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause does not prevent states from enacting bans on affirmative action in education. </p><p>The case arose after Michigan voters approved the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which amended the state constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment and public education. In a plurality opinion joined by two other justices, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that the ban on affirmative action was constitutional. Kennedy wrote that ""[t]here is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters."" Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer concurred in the result but filed or joined separate opinions. In her dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the voters of Michigan had ""changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities."" </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1426 Cached time: 20220514105736 Cache expiry: 3600 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [] CPU time usage: 0.222 seconds Real time usage: 0.274 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 6538/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 27491/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 19023/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 6/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 751/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.058/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 1712918/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 249.153 1 -total 85.83% 213.838 1 Template:Infobox_SCOTUS_case 63.86% 159.120 1 Template:Infobox 35.51% 88.476 1 Template:Infobox_US_Supreme_Court_case/courts 25.67% 63.962 224 Template:If_between 17.30% 43.113 1 Template:Short_description 14.14% 35.232 1 Template:Use_mdy_dates 8.03% 19.996 1 Template:Pagetype 7.39% 18.413 5 Template:Main_other 5.38% 13.409 1 Template:SCOTUS_URL_Docket -->"	schuette v coalition to defend affirmative action 572 us 291 2014 was a landmark decision of the supreme court of the united states concerning affirmative action and race and sexbased discrimination in public university admissions in a 62 decision the court held that the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause does not prevent states from enacting bans on affirmative action in education the case arose after michigan voters approved the michigan civil rights initiative which amended the state constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment and public education in a plurality opinion joined by two other justices justice anthony kennedy held that the ban on affirmative action was constitutional kennedy wrote that there is no authority in the constitution of the united states or in this courts precedents for the judiciary to set aside michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and stephen breyer concurred in the result but filed or joined separate opinions in her dissenting opinion associate justice sonia sotomayor wrote that the voters of michigan had changed the basic rules of the political process in that state in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities	United States Supreme Court case	united states supreme court case	Universities_and_colleges
Rolling admission	<p><b>Rolling admission</b> is a policy used by many colleges to admit freshmen to undergraduate programs. Many law schools in the United States also have rolling admissions policies. Under rolling admission, candidates are invited to submit their applications to the university anytime within a large window. The window is usually over six months long, and some schools do not have a previously specified end date (the window simply closes when all spots are filled). The university will then review the application and notify the applicant of their decision within a few weeks from submission. </p>	rolling admission is a policy used by many colleges to admit freshmen to undergraduate programs many law schools in the united states also have rolling admissions policies under rolling admission candidates are invited to submit their applications to the university anytime within a large window the window is usually over six months long and some schools do not have a previously specified end date the window simply closes when all spots are filled the university will then review the application and notify the applicant of their decision within a few weeks from submission	college admissions policy	college admissions policy	Universities_and_colleges
Parcoursup	<p><b>Parcoursup</b> is an application process designed by both the French Ministry of Education and the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation to allocate undergraduate places to high school students and other candidates, mainly undergraduate students wanting a reorientation. It was released in 2018 and replaced the former APB (Admission Post-Bac). In 2018, 666,000 high school students registered to Parcoursup in order to apply to an undergraduate program. The following year, the site received applications from approximately 651,000 high school students</p><p>The main objective of the platform was to achieve “meritocracy” as Emmanuel Macron and his government made it a priority. Parcoursup thus replaced the previous system of random drawing between students to implement an examination of each student file. </p><p>However, Parcoursup has suffered a lot of criticism. It is currently being blamed for creating anxiety among students, and being opaque because each university uses its own algorithm to decide which students will be admitted. It has also be blamed for the amount of work it generates within universities. Indeed, Parcoursup allows students to make from 1 to 10 wishes with as many as 20 subwishes for each of them. Hence, undergraduate programs receive far more applications than they used to and some universities can have to consider more than 100,000 student files. This has led to strikes within French universities and contributed to a controversy between left- and right-wing parties. </p>	parcoursup is an application process designed by both the french ministry of education and the french ministry of higher education research and innovation to allocate undergraduate places to high school students and other candidates mainly undergraduate students wanting a reorientation it was released in 2018 and replaced the former apb admission postbac in 2018 666000 high school students registered to parcoursup in order to apply to an undergraduate program the following year the site received applications from approximately 651000 high school studentsthe main objective of the platform was to achieve “ meritocracy ” as emmanuel macron and his government made it a priority parcoursup thus replaced the previous system of random drawing between students to implement an examination of each student file however parcoursup has suffered a lot of criticism it is currently being blamed for creating anxiety among students and being opaque because each university uses its own algorithm to decide which students will be admitted it has also be blamed for the amount of work it generates within universities indeed parcoursup allows students to make from 1 to 10 wishes with as many as 20 subwishes for each of them hence undergraduate programs receive far more applications than they used to and some universities can have to consider more than 100000 student files this has led to strikes within french universities and contributed to a controversy between left and rightwing parties	Parcoursup is a web service of the French ministry of Research and Education for the assigment to the advanced studies for the graduated students, which substitute, since January 2018, the old assigment system APB.	parcoursup is a web service of the french ministry of research and education for the assigment to the advanced studies for the graduated students which substitute since january 2018 the old assigment system apb	Universities_and_colleges

Quadrangle (architecture)	"<p>In architecture, a <b>quadrangle</b> (or colloquially, a <b>quad</b>) is a space or a courtyard, usually rectangular (square or oblong) in plan, the sides of which are entirely or mainly occupied by parts of a large building (or several smaller buildings). The word is probably most closely associated with college or university campus architecture, but quadrangles are also found in other buildings such as palaces. Most quadrangles are open-air, though a few have been roofed over (often with glass), to provide additional space for social meeting areas or coffee shops for students. </p><p>The word <i>quadrangle</i> was originally synonymous with <i>quadrilateral</i>, but this usage is now relatively uncommon.</p> <p>Some modern quadrangles resemble cloister gardens of medieval monasteries, called <i>garths</i>, which were usually square or rectangular, enclosed by covered arcades or cloisters. However, it is clear from the oldest examples (such as Mob Quad) which are plain and unadorned with arcades, that the medieval colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were creating practical accommodation for college members. Grander quadrangles that look like cloisters came later, once the idea of a college was well established and benefactors or founders wished to create more monumental buildings. Although architectonically analogous, for historical reasons quads in the colleges of the University of Cambridge are always referred to as courts (such as the Trinity Great Court). </p><p>In North America, Thomas Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia centered the housing and academic buildings in a Palladian form around three sides of the Lawn, a huge grassy expanse. Later, some American college and university planners imitated the Jeffersonian plan, the Oxbridge idea, Beaux-Arts forms, and other models. All five barracks at The Citadel (military college) feature quadrangles with red-and-white squares (the colors of the South Carolina battle flag), which are used for formations by the Corps of Cadets. </p><p>Quadrangles are also found in traditional Kerala houses (Naalukettu) and is known as the <i>Nadumittam</i> (""Middle Space"").</p>"	in architecture a quadrangle or colloquially a quad is a space or a courtyard usually rectangular square or oblong in plan the sides of which are entirely or mainly occupied by parts of a large building or several smaller buildings the word is probably most closely associated with college or university campus architecture but quadrangles are also found in other buildings such as palaces most quadrangles are openair though a few have been roofed over often with glass to provide additional space for social meeting areas or coffee shops for students the word quadrangle was originally synonymous with quadrilateral but this usage is now relatively uncommon some modern quadrangles resemble cloister gardens of medieval monasteries called garths which were usually square or rectangular enclosed by covered arcades or cloisters however it is clear from the oldest examples such as mob quad which are plain and unadorned with arcades that the medieval colleges at oxford and cambridge were creating practical accommodation for college members grander quadrangles that look like cloisters came later once the idea of a college was well established and benefactors or founders wished to create more monumental buildings although architectonically analogous for historical reasons quads in the colleges of the university of cambridge are always referred to as courts such as the trinity great court in north america thomas jeffersons design for the university of virginia centered the housing and academic buildings in a palladian form around three sides of the lawn a huge grassy expanse later some american college and university planners imitated the jeffersonian plan the oxbridge idea beauxarts forms and other models all five barracks at the citadel military college feature quadrangles with redandwhite squares the colors of the south carolina battle flag which are used for formations by the corps of cadets quadrangles are also found in traditional kerala houses naalukettu and is known as the nadumittam middle space	space or courtyard	space or courtyard	Universities_and_colleges
Satellite campus	<p>A <b>satellite campus</b> or <b>branch campus</b> or <b>regional campus</b> is a campus of a university or college that is physically at a distance from the original university or college area. This branch campus may be located in a different city, state, or country, and is often smaller than the main campus of an institution. The separate campuses may or may not be under the same accreditation and share resources or they share administrations but maintain separate budgets, resources, and other governing bodies. </p><p>In many cases, satellite campuses are intended to serve students who cannot travel far from home for college because of family responsibilities, their jobs, financial limitations, or other factors. The availability of branch campuses may increase higher education enrollment by nontraditional students.</p><p>Electronic communications technology has helped to facilitate the operation of satellite campuses. Classes taught at one campus can be transmitted to other locations via distance education, students at branch campuses can access library materials on the main campus electronically, and technology allows institutions to administer registration, admissions, and financial aid transactions remotely.</p><p>One growing trend is the establishment of international branch campuses. These are satellite campuses of a parent institution that is located outside the country where the satellite campus is located. The number of international branch campuses worldwide grew from 35 before 1999 to 162 in 2009, including 78 branches operated by United States universities. As of 2009, the United Arab Emirates was the host of 40 international branch campuses, more than any other nation. There were 15 international branch campuses in China, 12 in Singapore, nine in Qatar, and six in Canada. In addition to the United States, the home countries of institutions with international branches included Australia, whose universities operated a total of 14 international branches; the United Kingdom, with 13 international branches; and France and India, each of whose universities had a total of 11 international branches. Although the overall number of international branch campuses has grown rapidly, a total of 11 such campuses closed between 2004 and 2009. A new breed of branch campuses of Indian universities in the Persian Gulf region is emerging which aims to meet South Asians' aspirations to study abroad in a cost-efficient manner.</p><p>There are several regional satellite or branch campus consortia but only one national association in the United States.

Beutenberg Campus	<p>The <b>Beutenberg Campus</b> is a science and research site situated in southern Jena, Germany. The physician Hans Knöll founded the first biomedical research institute at Beutenberg in 1950. From 1970, it was run as the Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy (Zentralinstitut für Mikrobiologie und experimentelle Therapie - ZIMET) of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. From 1982 institutes focussing on physics were also set up on the site. Following German reunification in 1990, a multidisciplinary science and research centre was created in response to a recommendation by the German Council of Science and Humanities. </p><p>The campus currently hosts nine research institutes. These include three Leibniz Association institutes, two Max Planck Society institutes, one Fraunhofer Society institute, one institute funded by the State of Thuringia, as well as Friedrich Schiller University institutes. Two start-up centres, the Technology and Innovation Park Jena and the Bioinstrumentation centre, host more than 50 companies. In addition, Wacker Biotech GmbH has established biotechnology production facilities on campus. </p><p>Beutenberg Campus offers an interdisciplinary knowledge and technology platform for work in innovative research.
