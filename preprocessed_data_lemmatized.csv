Library of the Printed Web	"<p><b>Library of the Printed Web</b> is a physical archive devoted to web-to-print artists’ books, zines and other printout matter. Founded by Paul Soulellis in 2013, the collection was acquired by The Museum of Modern Art Library in January 2017. The project has been described as ""web culture articulated as printed artifact,"" an ""archive of archives,"" characterized as an ""accumulation of accumulations,"" much of it printed on demand. Techniques for appropriating web content used by artists in the collection include <i>grabbing</i>, <i>hunting</i>, <i>scraping</i> and <i>performing</i>, detailed by Soulellis in ""Search, Compile, Publish,"" and later referenced by Alessandro Ludovico.</p> <p>Among the 130 artists included in Library of the Printed Web are Olia Lialina, Mishka Henner, Clement Valla, Karolis Kosas, Lauren Thorson, Cory Arcangel, Silvio Lorusso, Angela Genusa, Jean Keller, Aaron Krach, Joachim Schmid, Benjamin Shaykin, Chantal Zakari, Richard Prince, David Horvitz and Penelope Umbrico. Over 240 works are in the collection. Library of the Printed Web continues to grow through curatorial acquisition and artist contributions.</p><p>The collection is used primarily for experimental publishing research, as a way to question issues of copyright, privacy and appropriation by artists on the internet, and as the basis for academic workshops in design and new media.</p><p>The project is frequently featured at book fairs, independent publishing conferences and schools, appearing at Miss Read Berlin Art Book Fair, Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart, Merz Akademie, Printed Matter's NY Art Book Fair, Offprint London, Theorizing the Web, Interrupt 3 at Brown University, The Internet Yami-Ichi, Printed Matter's LA Art Book Fair, Odds and Ends Art Book Fair at Yale Art Gallery, Rhode Island School of Design School of Visual Arts, International Center of Photography, School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and Offprint Paris.

Ashcan comic	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>ashcan comic</b> is a form of the American comic book originally created solely to establish trademarks on potential titles and not intended for sale. The practice was common in the 1930s and 1940s when the comic book industry was in its infancy, but was phased out after updates to US trademark law. The term was revived in the 1980s by Bob Burden, who applied it to prototypes of his self-published comic book. Since the 1990s, the term has been used to describe promotional materials produced in large print runs and made available for mass consumption. In the film and television industries, the term 'ashcan copy' has been adopted for low-grade material created to preserve a claim to licensed property rights. </p> "	run american burden prototype used by book term made sale intended large ashcan comic who material lowgrade right solely wa an bob since for when potential copy form produced film 1930s mass industry after preserve trademark 1940s applied update been of is revived but adopted consumption on 1980s it print originally his selfpublished out property claim law u television 1990s a created phased describe title not and practice promotional licensed the establish to common infancy available ha in	comic book produced only for legal reasons or promotional preview, rather than for full publication	for than book comic produced or reason promotional full publication preview legal rather only	Written_communication

Student publication	<p>A <b>student publication</b> is a media outlet such as a newspaper, magazine, television show, or radio station produced by students at an educational institution. These publications typically cover local and school-related news, but they may also report on national or international news as well. Most student publications are either part of a curricular class or run as an extracurricular activity.</p><p>Student publications serve as both a platform for community discussion and a place for those interested in journalism to develop their skills. These publications report news, publish opinions of students and faculty, and may run advertisements catered to the student body. Besides these purposes, student publications also serve as a watchdog to uncover problems at the respective institution. The majority of student publications are funded through their educational institution. Some funds may be generated through sales and advertisements, but the majority usually comes from the school itself.

Book	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>book</b> is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical arrangement is <i>codex</i> (plural, <i>codices</i>). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. </p><p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's <i>Physics</i> is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts. </p><p>The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats. </p><p>Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science <i>monograph</i> denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, ""bookworm"". A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.</p>"	investment academic intellectual contrast number sheet more had subject time like history also by writing selfsufficient book object term made blank leaf ordinary sale medium unrestricted are specialist consist antiquity considerable estimated other library where from cutout part serial can enough an finite this great account increased drawing be proust distributed codex several for single bookshop sevenvolume avid many thick entry bibliophile usage arrangement search composed that recording broadly restricted sense journal each form bookworm papyrus sturdy place written google notebook because reflecting scrapbook support typically predecessor page puzzle technical together still take doll complete need such chapter information length printed handheld appointment even photograph been of section magazine parlance lost contained nonserial composition replaces which whether read identified is set physic newspaper rather vellum cover prototypically on bound left monograph electronic it side line feature compose 2010 some sold borrowed approximately protected nor ebooks traded nation extended a long considered record may scholarly science colloquially denotes paper title or decreased not sketchbook image reference and abstract one diary scroll work although engraving parchment content the understood than to album bookstore called publication 130000000 reader aristotle longer only any wealthier whole novel published crossword compositional ha format plural with elsewhere collector physical autograph in volume	written text that can be published in printed or electronic form	published or form printed electronic written be in that can text	Written_communication
Book restoration	<p><b>Book restoration</b> is the renewal and repair of books. Techniques include cleaning; mending and filling damaged pages; restitching and rebinding. The first substantial work on the subject was Alfred Bonnardot's <i>Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres</i> which was first published in Paris in 1846. Further significant developments occurred as a result of specific events including the 1904 fire at the Turin National University Library and the 1966 flood of the Arno which damaged over a million items in the National Central Library in Florence.</p>	over lart which substantial florence arno restaurer is repair fire renewal et cleaning subject item and on first essai work book flood million sur turin result including rebinding the page university de damaged technique event library occurred 1846 1904 central alfred mending restitching livres paris 1966 wa published significant include at development estampes further filling a restoration of le specific in national bonnardots	repair and renovation	and renovation repair	Written_communication
Bookworm (insect)	"<p><b>Bookworm</b> is a general name for any insect that is said to bore through books.</p><p>The damage to books that is commonly attributed to ""bookworms"" is, in truth, not caused by any species of worm. Often, the larvae of various types of insects including beetles, moths and cockroaches, which may bore or chew through books seeking food, are responsible. Some such larvae exhibit a superficial resemblance to worms and are the likely inspiration for the term, though they are not true worms. In other cases, termites, carpenter ants, and woodboring beetles will first infest wooden bookshelves and later feed on books placed upon the shelves, attracted by the wood-pulp paper used in most commercial book production. </p><p>True book-borers are uncommon. The primary food sources for many ""bookworms"" are the leather or cloth bindings of a book, the glue used in the binding process, or molds and fungi that grow on or inside books. When the pages themselves are attacked, a gradual encroachment across the surface of one page or a small number of pages is typical, rather than the boring of holes through the entire book (see images on right).</p><p>The term has come to have a second, idiomatic use, indicative of a person who reads a great deal or to perceived excess: someone who devours books metaphorically. </p>"	case cockroach most number inspiration type commonly idiomatic used by surface book term deal are encroachment other who grow likely upon great infest bookshelf perceived leather shelf bookborers including for seeking many said will booksthe someone hole when that worm production later ant bookworm boring small page termite wooden metaphorically often food indicative such though they of themselves entire attributed carpenter attacked commercial which rightthe read is woodboring rather on bore damage source true inside fungi some resemblance binding moth insect cloth general mold a truth use placed primary may caused paper or not have person image and various one chew larva first attracted superficial gradual process excess uncommon second the come devours than to beetle feed typical any woodpulp responsible specie ha name across through exhibit see in glue	common name for any insect which bores through books	for which bore insect book name common through any	Written_communication

Ephemera	"<p><b>Ephemera</b> are transitory creations not meant to be retained or preserved. The word has origins extending to Ancient Greece, although its current understanding was only established in the 20th century; then the presently sovereign definition was affixed: ""the minor transient documents of everyday life"". The categorisation of ephemera still remains ambiguous, and various interpretations have been offered. Menus, newspapers, postcards, posters, plastic champagne glasses, portable classrooms and stickers have all been described as ephemera. </p><p>The nature of ephemera is varied and vast, some having had production quantities of millions. Since the 15th century, following the printing revolution, ephemera has been a long-standing element of everyday life. Some ephemera are ornate in their design, acquiring prestige, whereas others are minimal and notably utilitarian. Although disposability is a recurring and emphasised characteristic of ephemera in virtually all definitions, the quality of paper differs. </p><p>Ephemera has long been collected, with certain instances of ephemera intended to be collected. Victorian families pasted their collections of ephemera in scrapbooks. Hobbyists and institutions were among later collectors. In the 20th century, collectors of ephemera published literature on the matter and began to congregate, thus bolstering the cultural notice of ephemera. These collectors steered the decision towards preserving ephemera, which is now ubiquitous in archives and library special collections. </p><p>Ephemera has received academic attention.

Documents are also distinguished from ""realia"", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of ""document"" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2-dimensional representations.

Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus. </p><p>Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof. Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a ""bare outline"". </p><p>Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process. </p><p>A software program designed for processing outlines is called an outliner. </p>"	plan order most number presented us type subject syllabus writer confused also history used by letter writing book prefixing term organize summary gap thereof improve are subtopics course decimal additional fact tree manual from structure can without an alternating include this point be sentence designed processing several for integrated advised context application arranged many entry filled hierarchical major current that item index aid verbally path each while subitems form given bare written described provide rearranging specialized college style prose scholastic often such two knowledge overview below they discussing even differentiated prefix help existing of section subcategories entire topic composition ease which article organizational covered outliner is identify alphanumerical so list numerical it source coverage revision reverse document tool shall presentation exist level at least lack main listed further general software a divided their use created may paper into or not present example variety have table reference and if encyclopedia work essay note process content subdivided the come to referring called flow during drafting show only composing preceding program relationship with specific in field outline	list arranged to show hierarchical relationships	list arranged to relationship hierarchical show	Written_communication

Book	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>book</b> is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical arrangement is <i>codex</i> (plural, <i>codices</i>). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. </p><p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's <i>Physics</i> is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts. </p><p>The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats. </p><p>Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science <i>monograph</i> denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, ""bookworm"". A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.</p>"	investment academic intellectual contrast number sheet more had subject time like history also by writing selfsufficient book object term made blank leaf ordinary sale medium unrestricted are specialist consist antiquity considerable estimated other library where from cutout part serial can enough an finite this great account increased drawing be proust distributed codex several for single bookshop sevenvolume avid many thick entry bibliophile usage arrangement search composed that recording broadly restricted sense journal each form bookworm papyrus sturdy place written google notebook because reflecting scrapbook support typically predecessor page puzzle technical together still take doll complete need such chapter information length printed handheld appointment even photograph been of section magazine parlance lost contained nonserial composition replaces which whether read identified is set physic newspaper rather vellum cover prototypically on bound left monograph electronic it side line feature compose 2010 some sold borrowed approximately protected nor ebooks traded nation extended a long considered record may scholarly science colloquially denotes paper title or decreased not sketchbook image reference and abstract one diary scroll work although engraving parchment content the understood than to album bookstore called publication 130000000 reader aristotle longer only any wealthier whole novel published crossword compositional ha format plural with elsewhere collector physical autograph in volume	written text that can be published in printed or electronic form	published or form printed electronic written be in that can text	Written_communication

The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was woodblock printing, which appeared in China before 220 AD for cloth printing. However, it would not be applied to paper until the seventh century. Later developments in printing technology include the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD and the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century.

Data sheet	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>data sheet</b>, <b>data-sheet</b>, or <b>spec sheet</b> is a document that summarizes the performance and other characteristics of a product, machine, component (e.g., an electronic component), material, subsystem (e.g., a power supply), or software in sufficient detail that allows a buyer to understand what the product is and a design engineer to understand the role of the component in the overall system. Typically, a data sheet is created by the manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the connectivity of the devices. In cases where there is relevant source code to include, it is usually attached near the end of the document or separated into another file. Data sheets are created, stored, and distributed via product information management or product data management systems. </p><p>Depending on the specific purpose, a data sheet may offer an average value, a typical value, a typical range, engineering tolerances, or a nominal value. The type and source of data are usually stated on the data sheet. </p><p>A data sheet is usually used for commercial or technical communication to describe the characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. By contrast, a technical specification is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service. </p><p>The ideal data sheet specifies characteristics in a formal structure, according to a strict taxonomy, that allows the information to be processed by a machine.

Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization's lifetime, and are kept to show the function of that person or organization. Professional archivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as ""the secretions of an organism"", and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. </p><p>In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines of which many identical copies may exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.</p><p>A person who works in archives is called an archivist.

List of National Treasures of Japan (ancient documents)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The term ""National Treasure"" has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897. The definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. These ancient documents adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, a special body of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, based on their ""especially high historical or artistic value"". ""Ancient documents"" is one of thirteen categories of National Treasures recognized by the agency. The list presents 62 documents or sets of documents from classical to early modern Japan, from the Asuka period to the Meiji period. The actual number of items is more than 62 because groups of related objects have been combined into single entries. The list contains items of various type such as letters, diaries, records or catalogues, certificates, imperial decrees, testaments and maps. The documents record early Japanese government and Buddhism including early Japanese contact with China, the organization of the state and life at the Japanese imperial court. They are housed in 14 Japanese cities in temples (35), museums (13), libraries or archives (6), shrines (4), universities (2) and in private collections (2). Most entries (28) in the list are located in Kyoto. The documents in this list were made predominantly with a writing brush on paper and, in many cases, present important examples of calligraphy.</p><p>Writing was physically introduced to Japan from China in the form of inscribed artefacts at the beginning of the Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as archaeological National Treasures, include coins of the reign of Wang Mang (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound, the Seven-Branched Sword with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century. All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the Japanese. When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorative.</p><p>The concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje in the form of classical Chinese books likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls (<i>kansubon</i>). This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese writing system as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal. Examples include three archaeological National Treasures: Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror from about the 5th century, which is a poor copy of a Chinese original, the Inariyama Sword from 471 or 531 and the Eta Funayama burial mound sword from about the 5th century. The abrupt transition from an unfamiliarity with writing to reading and writing complicated works in a foreign language required the earliest Japanese texts be composed and read by people from the continent such as Wani. The Inariyama Sword is also the oldest example of man'yōgana use, a writing system that employs Chinese characters to represent the Japanese language. Soon after the introduction of writing, scribes were appointed to the provinces to ""record events and report conditions"".</p><p>While writing in Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, the number of documents written locally increased in the 7th century; though most of them have been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to become an integral part of Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the <i>Daigakuryo</i> (""University"") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho (""Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras""), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (<i>shakyōjo</i>) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.</p>"	housed burial asuka inariyama certificate poor 2nd located early 645–649 by term integral emperor continuing group instead required popularity likely extant national criterion denote code major others when shōtoku private yet contains while phonogram reading among dating mirror shrine bureau style two locally earliest map been of roll attributed character bronze founded 28 katakana is korean hiragana suda list category 6 prince recognized designated introduced organization value some kojiki law 4 original use may literate special or artistic factor one notably thirteen system japanese the buddhism during orthography show soon shikanoshima with enjoyed 574–622 agency ad selected sport treasure more june writing book affair confucianism become 62 kana gisho artefact well from part cultural wa daigakuryo 369 development testament 700—inscriptions be temple 670 shakyōjo for formed were 5th many scholar current sevenbranched later copy effect centralised classical coin introduction 689 them wang lost which ministry read requiring set but technology mistaken came funayama it modern museum chinese iron document event period property kyoto date based wani text 6th hachiman particularly a confucian japan ancient work meiji 1951 second combined historical actual 8–25 are—like abrupt body developed 35 province in case 400 number type mound used letter inscribed catalogue probably concept represent library collection include heian since increased including sangyō physically composed that item stone decorativethe baekje because written merely foreign kiyomihara high reform appointed prose length however they city taika there 531 era 14 on decree mirrors—the metal around life about state under their all mang caused into limited predominantly contact not present continent inscription various diary 2 scribe eta dependence shoki starting tōdaijiyama important than clear seal language education 13 people ha manufactured study chronicle nihon continued these sword most protection gold century had also object made are oldest 1stcentury happened large kingdom university increasing census imperial archaeological who mid6th traditionally an this understanding beginning manuscript according originated single manyōgana certainly reign entry adhere copying related form 727 brush religion christian 3rd culture after need such court though changed late complicated three 1897 before strongly sutra report promoted educated end government origin official 690 china calligraphywriting 8th at believe definition record science 7th annotated decoration paper example 471 transition have and legend 9 commentary conditionswhile tenchi kansubon to archive especially employ longer any unfamiliarity	national treasures of Japan, ancient documents	document of treasure ancient japan national	Written_communication

The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of lexicography, and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first dictionaries. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses.

Green paper	<p>In the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong, the United States and the European Union, a <b>green paper</b> is a tentative government report and consultation document of policy proposals for debate and discussion.

Fieldnotes	<p><b>Fieldnotes</b> refer to qualitative notes recorded by scientists or researchers in the course of field research, during or after their observation of a specific organism or phenomenon they are studying. The notes are intended to be read as evidence that gives meaning and aids in the understanding of the phenomenon. Fieldnotes allow the researcher to access the subject and record what they observe in an unobtrusive manner. </p><p>One major disadvantage of taking fieldnotes is that they are recorded by an observer and are thus subject to (a) memory and (b) possibly, the conscious or unconscious bias of the observer. It is best to record fieldnotes while making observations in the field or immediately after leaving the site to avoid forgetting important details. Some suggest immediately transcribing one's notes from a smaller pocket-sized notebook to something more legible in the evening or as soon as possible. Errors which occur from transcription often outweigh the errors which stem from illegible writing in the actual “field” notebook (Ramsen 1977). </p><p>Fieldnotes are particularly valued in descriptive sciences such as ethnography, biology, ecology, geology, and archaeology, each of which have long traditions in this area. </p>	observe give more subject researcher by writing tradition descriptive 1977 are intended course observer from disadvantage an possible unobtrusive evening “ this understanding be area smaller outweigh transcribing major manner best that aid each while notebook observation archaeology ramsen allow after often such valued they ecology of thus recorded site which phenomenon meaning access read is biology field immediately ” evidence unconscious scientist it b conscious some error particularly their a taking studying occur fieldnotes long record science something or pocketsized ethnography have and one organism leaving research note forgetting avoid refer actual the stem important legible to during soon qualitative illegible bias what memory transcription making possibly suggest specific in detail geology	notes recorded by researchers in the course of field research	the researcher course by research note of in field recorded	Written_communication
Tract (literature)	<p>A <b>tract</b> is a literary work and, in current usage, usually religious in nature. The notion of what constitutes a tract has changed over time. By the early part of the 21st century, a tract referred to a brief pamphlet used for religious and political purposes, though far more often the former. Tracts are often either left for someone to find or handed out. However, there have been times in history when the term implied tome-like works. A <i>tractate</i>, a derivative of a tract, is equivalent in Hebrew literature to a <i>chapter</i> of the Christian Bible. </p>	for former there or is tract usage nature someone when literature current find literary more have century and religious early time history work by used left handed tomelike term either political bible pamphlet are the christian brief tractate to out implied often derivative equivalent chapter part usually 21st purpose though hebrew changed what referred however ha constitutes far been a of over in notion	type of literary work	literary type of work	Written_communication

The manifest may be used by people having an interest in the transport to ensure that passengers and cargo listed as having been placed on board the transport at the beginning of its passage continue to be on board when it arrives at its destination.</p><blockquote><p>This document, made up generally by the ship's broker, from the contents of the bills of lading, contains a specification of the nature and quantity of the cargo laden, and is generally attested officially, and in some countries notarially.

Inspired by the <i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica</i>, it was published by the Academia das Ciências de Lisboa between 1856 and 1917 and divided into four sections: <i>Scriptores</i> (writers), <i>Leges et Consuetudines</i> (laws and customs), <i>Diplomata et Chartae</i> (diplomas and charters) and <i>Inquisitiones</i> (investigations). The first three were compiled under the direction of Alexandre Herculano before 1873, and the last, <i>Inquisitiones</i>, between 1888 and 1897, after his death.

Historical document	"<p><b>Historical documents</b> are original documents that contain important historical information about a person, place, or event and can thus serve as primary sources as important ingredients of the historical methodology. </p><p>Significant historical documents can be deeds, laws, accounts of battles (often given by the victors or persons sharing their viewpoint), or the exploits of the powerful. Though these documents are of historical interest, they do not detail the daily lives of ordinary people, or the way society functioned. Anthropologists, historians and archeologists generally are more interested in documents that describe the day-to-day lives of ordinary people, indicating what they ate, their interaction with other members of their households and social groups, and their states of mind. It is this information that allows them to try to understand and describe the way society was functioning at any particular time in history. Greek ostraka provide good examples of historical documents from ""among the common people"". </p><p>Many documents that are produced today, such as personal letters, pictures, contracts, newspapers, and medical records, would be considered valuable historical documents in the future. However most of these will be lost in the future since they are either printed on ordinary paper which has a limited lifespan, or even stored in digital formats, then lost track over time. </p><p>Some companies and government entities are attempting to increase the number of documents that will survive the passage of time, by taking into account the preservation issues, and either printing documents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of them surviving indefinitely, or placing selected documents in time capsules or other special storage environments. </p> "	these selected most number interaction survive more digital would time history by letter surviving society ordinary are household sharing ostraka allows likelihood future victor group other preservation member social from can wa this since account functioning mind be over archeologist picture many will stored company serve manner that contract ingredient understand produced increase place given either among provide valuable capsule passage daytoday often such them medical information though printed lifespan storage however they placing even deed generally thus of functioned environment lost viewpoint which then is today newspaper on personal particular good exploit it source way interest government life document about track event do some law historian state original significant at entity printing a their taking primary considered record describe special issue battle paper limited or into attempting ate not example contain person indefinitely and greek historical the interested important daily to common indicating any powerful anthropologist try what methodology people ha format with in detail	original documents with important historical information	original important document with information historical	Written_communication

Microprinting	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p><b>Microprinting</b> is the production of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye. To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, image scanning, or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. Microprint is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by widespread digital methods. </p><p>While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. (<span>U.S. Patent 2260551A</span>, <span>U.S. Patent 2260552A</span>) This process proved to produce a 6"" by 9"" index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal-sized publications he was reproducing.

Silva rerum	"<p><b>Silva rerum</b> (plural: <i>silvae rerum</i>, Latin for ""forest of things""; also Polonized as <b>sylwa</b>, sometimes described as <b>home chronicle</b>) was a multi-generational chronicle kept by many Polish and Lithuanian noble families from the 16th through 18th centuries.

It was added to by many generations, and contained various information: diary-type entries on current events, memoirs, letters, political speeches, copies of legal documents, gossips, jokes and anecdotes, financial documents, economic information (price of grain, etc.), philosophical musings, poems, genealogical trees, advice (agricultural, medical, moral) for the descendants and others. The wealth of information in silva is staggering; they contain anything that their authors wished to record for future generations. Some silvae rerum were of truly enormous proportions, with thousands of pages (Gloger cites one of 1764 pages) although most common size is from 500 to 800 pages. They were written from 16th century (the earliest entries are from the times of the king Stefan Batory) to the mid-18th century (times of the Saxon kings in Poland).</p><p>Silvae rerum were the source of our modern knowledge of poems by such writers as Andrzej Morsztyn, and even long diaries, including the famous <i>Chocim War</i> by Wacław Potocki and the <i>Diaries</i> by Jan Chryzostom Pasek.

The desired design is cut out of the selected medium and then the image is transferred to a surface through the use of spray paint or roll-on paint. </p><p>The process of stencilling involves applying paint across a stencil to form an image on a surface below. Sometimes multiple layers of stencils are used on the same image to add colours or create the illusion of depth. </p><p>Because the stencil stays uniform throughout its use, it is easier for an artist to replicate what could be a complicated piece - at a high rate when compared to other conventional tagging methods. </p>	for desired paper sometimes or throughout then is selected add conventional when uniform that multiple image and cardboard on rollon could used transferred make surface form because made process applying colour it medium stencil cut paint are easily illusion replicate the rate high piece artist graffiti to other depth out easier reproducible text an what below at layer create involves method across stencilling complicated a same spray of use through be stay compared design tagging	a form of graffiti that makes use of stencils	graffiti make form a of use stencil that	Written_communication

Latrinalia	<p><b>Latrinalia</b> is a type of deliberately inscribed or etched marking made on latrines; that is, bathrooms or lavatory walls.

Rash is the first feature-length documentary in Australia to focus on the new art form of street art. </p><p>Filming began in 2002 on this documentary, which conveys the commitment, ideals and beliefs demonstrated in Melbourne street art. Artists use a variety of approaches including bill posters, stencils, and performance art put the artwork right in the public eye. </p><p>The film was made in the lead up to the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Before the games local councils were juggling the need to present a clean and safe city for visitors against the enthusiastic activities of street and graffiti artists.

Stencil	"<p><b>Stencilling</b> produces an image or pattern by applying pigment to a surface under an intermediate object with designed gaps in it which create the pattern or image by only allowing the pigment to reach some parts of the surface. The <b>stencil</b> is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object; the context in which <i>stencil</i> is used makes clear which meaning is intended. In practice, the (object) stencil is usually a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, wood or metal, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material. </p><p>The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. Although aerosol or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made with the intention of being reused. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil <b>islands</b> (sections of material that are inside cut-out ""holes"" in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with <b>bridges</b> (narrow sections of material that are not cut out). </p><p>Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as <b>pochoir</b>. A related technique (which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions) is aerography, in which spray-painting is done <i>around</i> a three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment. </p><p>Screen printing also uses a stencil process, as does mimeography. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called ""stencils"". Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography, the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images. </p> "	underlying human surrealist master most us sheet multiple plastic bc also used by surface letter gap object made removed narrow are intended reach intention mimeographed must instead other technique visual sprayed material from where cutout 10000 part can wa an referred connecting this doe bridge stencilling same pigment designed be for were context many remain allowing hole hand that direct reused related produced island among cut rapidly dating typically broken page spraypainting bone after often such negative printed aerosol they create applied aerography of section composition cave which meaning both is color produce mouth on outline mimeography colour it metal advantage around inside his hollow some out different blown usually printing handprint threedimensional under done a animal stream use art being using pochoir found paper into or not onetime image and positive down practice one work make although intermediate applying process stencil wood reusable multicolored intact the artist applicability to pattern called clear during repeatedly only stenciling layer ha key with thin solid resulting through screen in design painting	thin sheet of material, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface	underlying or sheet produce on used letter surface it cut the to material from an with thin a of design	Written_communication

However, due to most instances of graffiti occurring in public spaces, local governments are responsible for <b>graffiti removal</b> in order to maintain the beautification of their local shire, council or city. </p>	for in or public order most instance that have and practice beautification signifies removal local are therefore government the decay council space value graffiti to outlawed property maintain detriment urban occurring an however shire vandalism seen due responsible city ha act been a detrimental their of area long considered	process	process	Written_communication
Berlin Wall graffiti art	<p>The Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961 to separate West Berlin and East Berlin during the Cold War. All the differences between the countries made it a perfect place for people to express their opinions, especially on their preferences and dislikes. In the 1980s, the wall was reconstructed and made 14 feet (4.3 m) tall. Graffiting on the wall became popular for artists from all over the world and a place where tourists would go and admire the artwork. The West Berlin side of the wall had artwork completely covering the wall, while the East Berlin side was kept blank because people were not permitted to get close enough to the eastside of the wall to paint anything. </p><p>The Berlin Wall was one of the largest canvases in the world. Much of the artwork was not claimed by artists and remains anonymous. Because the wall was open to everyone, there were no restrictions on what artists could put on the wall. Almost all of the wall has been removed and it only exists in places such as Potsdamer Platz, the East Side Gallery, and Bernauer Straße; many segments are now exhibited in other countries; see List of Berlin Wall segments. </p>	remains had would between by made blank removed permitted are everyone express other from where open wall go enough wa popular gallery over for were much many eastside preference war reconstructed could tall while put place because canvas opinion straße almost restriction platz east such close been admire of constructed cold artwork there see 14 separate now west on 1980s list it side dislike difference exists tourist 1961 claimed a their no all 43 exhibited not kept covering potsdamer and largest bernauer one anything paint country perfect the foot artist to world segment during especially anonymous only m what completely people ha graffiting get berlin became in	overview about the Berlin Wall graffiti art	the wall about graffiti berlin art overview	Written_communication
Digital graffiti	"<p><b>Digital graffiti</b> is the act of creating graffiti art using a computer vision system. Various groups and companies have pioneered digital graffiti since technology advances made it possible. Most notably is the Graffiti Research Lab based in the US with their L.A.S.E.R. Tag system. </p><p>Inspired by the New York laser graffiti movement, in 2008 the first commercially available digital graffiti wall was produced by Luma, named the YrWall. A specially adapted spray can emits IR light instead of paint, which is then tracked by a computer vision system to recreate the ""sprayed"" image onto the wall using a projector. </p><p>Any system that allows art to be created on a large scale in a similar manner to more traditional graffiti falls under the heading digital graffiti. </p><p>Cisco Systems has released a mobile application called [Digital Graffiti] patented by Cisco Systems, Inc. to allow people to place messages of varying size, color, length of time visible, and viewing distance (say visible from 20 feet away) on a physical location, say a building, an office, a cubicle, or a specific location using their augmented reality mobile application.

Graffito (archaeology)	"<p>A <b>graffito</b> (plural ""graffiti""), in an archaeological context, is a deliberate mark made by scratching or engraving on a large surface such as a wall. The marks may form an image or writing. The term is not usually used of the engraved decoration on small objects such as bones, which make up a large part of the Art of the Upper Paleolithic, but might be used of the engraved images, usually of animals, that are commonly found in caves, though much less well known than the cave paintings of the same period; often the two are found in the same caves. In archaeology, the term may or may not include the more common modern sense of an ""unauthorized"" addition to a building or monument.

Moss graffiti	<p><b>Moss graffiti</b> is a type of street art that uses living moss to write on the walls of public spaces. The art is made by growing moss on mats, cutting it into shapes and gluing it to a wall. By replacing the harmful chemicals found in paints (such as methanol, which damages the nervous system when consumed in large quantities) with plant matter, the artist can still create works without damaging the environment. After application, the moss grows, adding a new dimension to the art medium as well as extending the concept of guerrilla gardening. </p><p>There are many fake videos and articles online that claim moss graffiti can be created in a blender. They claim by taking clumps of moss and blending them with water (sometimes beer), buttermilk, yogurt, and corn syrup you can create a thick liquid that can be painted on a wall by a brush. They claim that applications of the moss mixture or water may be needed to create a fuller effect. However photos or time-lapse videos of the results are never shown. Many people have tried to replicate the process but it didn't work. The liquid was too thick to paint with a brush, it fell off after a few days or weeks and it didn't grow. </p>	sometimes cutting us blending type fell by shape made photo medium street are damaging concept large write chemical well wall grow can without wa never quantity too day mat be you result moss application many thick shown when water that off plant fuller syrup effect brush online yogurt replicate mixture still clump didnt consumed after such living them liquid gardening however they create of extending environment adding week video which article there nervous is gluing but replacing methanol on damage dimension matter it tried space claim needed growing new a guerrilla taking created art may corn found into or public have and work blender process paint buttermilk system beer the artist fake graffiti to timelapse grows harmful people few with painted in	type of street art that uses living moss to write on the walls of public spaces	on the write moss wall space to that public street of us living type art	Written_communication

2007 Boston Mooninite panic	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>On the morning of January 31, 2007, the Boston Police Department and the Boston Fire Department mistakenly identified battery-powered LED placards depicting the Mooninites, characters from the Adult Swim animated television series <i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</i>, as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), leading to a massive panic. Placed throughout Boston, Massachusetts, and the surrounding cities of Cambridge and Somerville by Peter ""Zebbler"" Berdovsky and Sean Stevens, these devices were part of a nationwide guerrilla marketing advertising campaign for <i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters</i>. </p><p>The massive panic led to controversy and criticism from U.S. media sources, including <i>The Boston Globe</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Fox News, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, CNN, and <i>The Boston Herald</i>. Some ridiculed the city's response to the devices – including the arrests of the two men hired to place the placards around the area – as disproportionate and indicative of a generation gap between city officials and the younger residents of Boston, at whom the ads were targeted. Several sources noted that the hundreds of officers in the Boston police department or city emergency planning office on scene were unable to identify the figure depicted for several hours until a young staffer at Mayor Thomas Menino's office saw the media coverage and recognized the figures. </p><p>After the devices were removed, the Boston Police Department stated in its defense that the ad devices shared some similarities with improvised explosive devices, with them also discovering an identifiable power source, a circuit board with exposed wiring, and electrical tape. Investigators were not mollified by the discovery that the devices were not explosive in nature, stating they still intended to determine ""if this event was a hoax or something else entirely"". Although city prosecutors eventually concluded there was no ill intent involved in the placing of the ads, the city continues to refer to the event as a ""bomb hoax"" (implying intent) rather than a ""bomb scare"".</p><p>Reflecting years later, various academics and media sources have characterized the phenomenon as a form of social panic. Gregory Bergman wrote in his 2008 book <i>BizzWords</i> that the devices were basically a self-made form of the children's toy Lite-Brite. Bruce Schneier wrote in his 2009 book <i>Schneier on Security</i> that Boston officials were ""ridiculed"" for their overreaction to the incident. In his 2009 book <i>Secret Agents</i>, historian and communication professor Jeremy Packer discussed a cultural phenomenon called the ""panic discourse"" and described the incident as a ""spectacular instance of this panic"". In a 2012 article, <i>The Boston Phoenix</i> called the incident the ""Great Mooninite Panic of 2007"". A 2013 publication by WGBH News wrote that the majority of Boston youth thought that the arrests of two men who placed devices were not justified.</p>"	ad these security 31 younger academic throughout 2008 phoenix department instance secret peter between berdovsky time also by office prosecutor gap determine book packer toy nationwide medium removed intended who social from young shared mooninite series part generation cultural wa hour meninos an bergman overreaction this great news leading los defense including january francisco area gregory selfmade several nature for 2009 were massachusetts boston thought childrens planning morning that involved ied ridiculed mayor incident later discovering exposed place angeles form described film wiring 2007 jeremy thomas response still spectacular massive eventually after indicative implying two them san batterypowered scene until colon movie resident they city concluded force board placing bomb characterized depicted advertising entirely year of stated disproportionate led character explosive article phenomenon there identified identify discussed hunger criticism rather officer on unable swim animated schneier mollified recognized it device source saw investigator justified coverage basically tape ill around – his official hired event some noted figure wrote campaign arrest agent historian marketing depicting stating at u television hoax controversy new a power guerrilla no fox placed their bruce aqua identifiable something cnn mistakenly stevens theater surrounding or intent emergency fire york improvised staffer not discovery have 2013 zebbler and teen whom various discourse 2012 if majority mooninites panic litebrite although wgbh men electrical placard refer the police professor youth than to bizzwords targeted called similarity publication circuit else adult hundred scarereflecting sean continues herald with communication cambridge chronicle somerville globe in	2007 incident	2007 incident	Written_communication

Akin to Sipson Green it was a scattered agricultural locality of Harmondsworth. The two lightly populated places dotted the brickearth-over-gravel soils in the east of Harmondsworth which historically butted on to Hounslow Heath. Yards from the lane, while the heath existed, General William Roy mapped one end of the first baseline for measuring the distance between the Paris and Greenwich observatories, the first precise distance survey in Britain, in 1784. </p><p>By the late 19th century Heathrow had developed three main agricultural settlement clusters with orchards and fields worked by teams of labourers — <b>Heathrow Hall</b>, Perrotts Farm and on some measures <b>Perry Oaks</b> at a fork in the southwest end of the lane.

Willard, Virginia	<p>The former unincorporated community of <b>Willard</b> (also known as <b>Willard Crossroads</b>) was located in what is now a part of Washington Dulles International Airport in the U.S. state of Virginia. </p><p>The village was named after Joseph Edward Willard, a delegate to the Virginia General Assembly from 1893 to 1901, then Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Although Willard lived in Loudoun County, he represented Fairfax County, because the village was only 1,500 feet (460 meters) from the county border. Willard owned a 50-acre (20-hectare) estate in Fairfax. His father was Joseph Clapp Willard, the owner of the famed Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. </p><p>Willard was at the intersection of Willard Road (now Stonecroft Boulevard) and Sterling Road (now Horsepen Road), surrounded by extensive farmland, housing, schools, places of worship, the Willard store (until 1907), and Blue Ridge Airfield (1938–1951). Willard stood west of Floris, north of Pleasant Valley, and south of Farmwell (now Ashburn). Willard was regarded as a crossroads and a distinctive community until construction of Washington Dulles International Airport began in 1958. </p><p>Approximately 26 square miles (67 square kilometers) of Virginia land from Willard, Chantilly, Pleasant Valley, Sterling, and Ashburn was bought for construction. By the airport's completion, all remains of civilization before 1958 on this land had virtually disappeared, except a stretch of Willard Rd (used as a service road), and three storage outbuildings between Runways 1C/19C and 1R/19L. </p>	remains construction had located stonecroft ashburn between 26 square also used by housing road 1c19c lieutenant 50acre crossroad intersection boulevard airfield county stretch joseph from regarded part wa meter edward lived border this runway he blue 1938–1951 dulles famed for land former floris service disappeared kilometer store school bought because place farmwell except fairfax delegate 460 distinctive 1958 after 1907 extensive until 1500 storage pleasant father represented loudoun of three sterling before 1901 stood then is 20hectare estate international now west valley on south 1r19l horsepen his governor farmland surrounded worship washington approximately community dc state named at u completion general a owner virtually mile 1893 all owned airport outbuilding began and chantilly civilization although village hotel known the foot clapp willard unincorporated to virginia assembly only ridge rd what 67 north in	human settlement in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States of America	state human america county loudoun of settlement in virginia united	Airports

Altona, Ontario	"<p><b>Altona</b> is a ghost town located in Pickering, Ontario, at Sideline 30 and the Pickering-Uxbridge Town Line. It is just east of Whitchurch-Stouffville, and was named after Altona, now a borough of Hamburg, Germany.</p> <p>It was founded by ethnic Swiss-German Mennonites who had migrated from Pennsylvania in the United States. The first flour and saw mills in Altona were built by Abraham Reesor, son of Peter Reesor and a nephew to Abraham Stouffer, in 1850, on Lot 30, Concession 9, a short distance south of the Uxbridge-Pickering Townline. In the same year, Joseph Monkhouse built a general store and William Cooper an inn.</p> <p>In 1852, the Altona Mennonite Meeting House (5475 Sideline 30, Pickering) was erected, constructed by area Mennonite settlers. The bricks were made at the Cherrywood brick yard. Local families included the Barkeys, Reesors, Widemans, Nighswanders, Hoovers and Stouffers. The first grave is dated 1835. The founder of Stouffville, Abraham Stouffer and his wife Elizabeth Reesor Stouffer, are buried here.</p><p>The first schoolhouse was built in 1834; in 1856 there were 256 inhabitants, ""unable to read and write, about 30%."" By 1869 the hamlet had 200 residents and a regular stage coach to Stouffville and Toronto. In 1910 there was still a daily stage to Stouffville, but Altona's population had fallen to only 100 people.</p><p>The churches, school, store (former hotel) and many homes remained into the 21st century, but all have been expropriated and most boarded up by the federal government for a proposed plan to build Pickering airport, a second international airport in the Greater Toronto Area. One of the few remaining houses is the ""Old Barkey Home"", built in 1856 by the Mennonite farmer and preacher Daniel Barkey. Under the current plan, the approach for one of the three landing strips for the Pickering Airport would be directly over the former hamlet of Altona, with planes descending at an elevation of approximately 300 metres. The plan anticipates 11.9 million passengers per year (or 32,600 per day) by 2032.

Trapped in the Sky	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>""<b>Trapped in the Sky</b>"" is the first episode of <i>Thunderbirds</i>, a British Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) for ITC Entertainment. Written by the Andersons, it was first broadcast on ATV Midlands on 30 September 1965. </p><p>Set in the 2060s, the series follows the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that uses technologically-advanced rescue vehicles to save human life. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, founder of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the organisation's main fleet: the <i>Thunderbird</i> machines. In ""Trapped in the Sky"", master criminal the Hood plants a bomb on board the new atomic-powered airliner <i>Fireflash</i> before it departs on its maiden flight. Unable to land for fear of setting off the bomb, the crew and passengers' only hope of survival lies with International Rescue. </p><p>While planning the episode, the Andersons drew inspiration from Gerry's memories of his National Service in the RAF, during which he witnessed the fatal crash of a Mosquito aircraft and the emergency landing of a damaged Spitfire. To save studio space, special effects director Derek Meddings filmed the rescue of <i>Fireflash</i> on a static set using a system of looping canvasses instead of a miniature runway. </p><p>""Trapped in the Sky"" was originally filmed as a 25-minute pilot in late 1964. Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, was so impressed by the production that he ordered APF to re-write and extend every <i>Thunderbirds</i> episode from 25 to 50 minutes so that the series would fill a one-hour TV timeslot. Well received on its first broadcast, ""Trapped in the Sky"" is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of <i>Thunderbirds</i>.

Flight information display system	"<p>A <b>flight information display system</b> (<b>FIDS</b>) is a computer system used in airports to display flight information to passengers, in which a computer system controls mechanical or electronic display boards or TV screens in order to display arriving and departing flight information in real-time. The displays are located inside or around an airport terminal. A virtual version of a FIDS can also be found on most airport websites and teletext systems. In large airports, there are different sets of FIDS for each terminal or even each major airline. FIDS are used to inform passengers of boarding gates, departure/arrival times, destinations, notifications of flight delays/flight cancellations, and partner airlines, et al. </p><p>Each line on an FIDS indicates a different flight number accompanied by: </p> <ul><li>the airline name/logo and/or its IATA or ICAO airline designator (can also include names/logos of interlining/codesharing airlines or partner airlines, e.g. HX252/BR2898.)</li> <li>the city of origin or destination, and any intermediate points</li> <li>the expected arrival or departure time and/or the updated time (reflecting any delays)</li> <li>the gate number</li> <li>the check-in counter numbers or the name of the airline handling the check-in</li> <li>the status of the flight, such as ""Landed"", ""Delayed"", ""Boarding"", etc.</li></ul><p>Due to code sharing, a flight may be represented by a series of different flight numbers.

Airport apron	<p>The <b>airport apron</b>, <b>apron</b>, <b>flight line</b>, <b>ramp</b>, or <b>tarmac</b> is the area of an airport where aircraft are parked, unloaded or loaded, refueled, boarded, or maintained. Although the use of the apron is covered by regulations, such as lighting on vehicles, it is typically more accessible to users than the runway or taxiway. However, the apron is not usually open to the general public and a permit may be required to gain access. An apron's designated areas for aircraft parking are called <i>aircraft stands</i>.</p><p>By extension, the term <i>apron</i> is also used to identify the air traffic control position responsible for coordinating movement on this surface at busier airports. When the aerodrome control tower does not have control over the apron, the use of the apron may be controlled by an <i>apron management service</i> (<i>apron control</i> or <i>apron advisory</i>) to provide coordination between the users. Apron control allocates aircraft parking stands (gates) and communicates this information to tower or ground control and to airline handling agents; it also authorises vehicle movements where they could conflict with taxiing aircraft such as outside of painted road markings. The authority responsible for the aprons is also responsible for relaying to ATC information about the apron conditions such as water, snow, construction or maintenance works on or adjacent to the apron, temporary hazards such as birds or parked vehicles, systems failure etc. Procedures should be established for a coordinated information provision between the aircraft, vehicle, apron control unit and ATC to facilitate the orderly transition of aircraft between the apron management unit and the aerodrome control tower.</p><p>The apron is designated by the ICAO as not being part of the maneuvering area but included in the movement area. <i>Aircraft stand taxilanes</i> (providing access to aircraft stands) and <i>apron taxiways</i> (taxi routes across the apron) are located on the apron.

Departure control system	"<p>A <b>departure control system</b> (DCS) automates processing an airline's airport management operation, which includes managing the information required for airport check-in, printing boarding cards, baggage acceptance, boarding, load control and aircraft checks. </p><p>Today, DCS mostly (98%) manage e-tickets using interfaces from a number of devices, including check-in kiosks, online check-in, mobile boarding cards, and baggage handling. DCS are able to identify, capture and update reservations from an airline's computer reservation system for passengers stored in a so-called passenger name record (PNR). A DCS is used to update reservations, typically as checked-in, boarded, flown or another status. </p><p>Additionally and increasingly, a DCS for some city-pair sectors may also interface with immigration control (such as Advance Passenger Information System) for visa, immigration and passenger no-fly watchlists. </p><p>Historically, systems developed in North America have incorporated DCS functions as part of the reservations systems with check-in being initiated directly from the PNR. Load control (weight and balance) is then provided by a standalone application.

Consolidated rental car facility	"<p>A <b>consolidated rental car facility</b> (CRCF) or <b>consolidated rental car center</b> (CONRAC) is a complex that hosts numerous car rental agencies, typically found at airports in the United States. </p><p>The largest incentive for building consolidated facilities is reduced vehicle congestion in the airport area, As one fleet of shuttle buses can serve all car rental agencies, instead of each company operating their own buses. Congestion can be further reduced by connecting the consolidated facility to the airport terminal with a people mover. </p><p>Consolidated facilities are typically built around two areas: a customer service building where each company have counters to serve renters, and a ""ready/return"" lot or garage where cars are temporarily parked while ready and awaiting a renter, or when recently returned and in need of servicing before the next renter. </p><p>Facilities usually also feature a Quick Turn Around (QTA) area on-site or nearby, where light maintenance of vehicles can be conducted including cleaning, fueling, and inspection of engine fluids.

Airport check-in	"<p><b>Airport check-in</b> is the process whereby an airline approves airplane passengers to board an airplane for a flight. Airlines typically use service counters found at airports for this process, and the check-in is normally handled by an airline itself or a handling agent working on behalf of an airline. Passengers usually hand over any baggage that they do not wish or are not allowed to carry in the aircraft's cabin and receive a boarding pass before they can proceed to board their aircraft. </p><p>Check-in is usually the first procedure for a passenger when arriving at an airport, as airline regulations require passengers to check in by certain times prior to the departure of a flight. This duration spans from 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the destination and airline (with self check in, this can be expanded to 24 hours, if checking in by online processes). During this process, the passenger often has the ability to ask for special accommodations such as seating preferences, inquire about flight or destination information, accumulate frequent flyer program miles, or pay for upgrades. The airline check-in's main function, however, is to accept luggage that is to go in the aircraft's cargo hold and issue boarding passes. The required time is sometimes written in the reservation, sometimes written somewhere in websites, and sometimes only referred as ""passengers should allow sufficient time for check-in"". </p><p>In-town check-in service is a service offered by some cities such as Abu Dhabi, Seoul, Hong Kong, Delhi, Kuala Lumpur–International, Stockholm, Vienna, Toronto and Taipei, where passengers may check in luggage in designated places within the city but outside the airport.

Automatic terminal information service	<p><b>Automatic terminal information service</b>, or <b>ATIS</b>, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas, i.e. airports and their immediate surroundings. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important NOTAMs. Pilots usually listen to an available ATIS broadcast before contacting the local control unit, which reduces the controllers' workload and relieves frequency congestion.</p><p>In the US, ATIS will include (in this order): the airport or facility name; a phonetic letter code; time of the latest weather observation in UTC time; weather information consisting of wind direction and velocity, visibility, obstructions to vision, sky condition, temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, density altitude advisory if appropriate; and other pertinent remarks, including runway in use. If it exists, the weather observation includes remarks of lightning, cumulonimbus, and towering cumulus clouds. Additionally, ATIS may contain Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) alert and advisory, reported unauthorized laser illumination events, instrument or visual approaches in use, departure runways, taxiway closures, new or temporary changes to runway length, runway condition and codes, other optional information, and advisories. </p><p>The recording is updated in fixed intervals or when there is a significant change in the information, e.g. a change in the active runway. It is given a letter designation (e.g. <i>bravo</i>) from the ICAO spelling alphabet. The letter progresses through the alphabet with every update and starts at <i>alpha</i> after a break in service of 12 hours or more. When contacting the local control unit, pilots indicate their <i>information &lt;letter&gt;</i>, where &lt;letter&gt; is the ATIS identification letter of the ATIS transmission the pilot received. This helps the ATC controller verify that the pilot has all current information.</p><p>Many airports also employ the use of Data-link ATIS (D-ATIS). D-ATIS is a text-based, digitally transmitted version of the ATIS audio broadcast. It is accessed via a data link service such as the ACARS and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft. D-ATIS is incorporated on the aircraft as part of its electronic system, such as an EFB or an FMS. D-ATIS may be incorporated into the core ATIS system, or be realized as a separate system with a data interface between voice ATIS and D-ATIS. </p>	audio control visibility reduces remark order aircraft more pertinent between start time setting also by letter incorporated bravo link facility other unit manportable closure version aeronautical visual from towering updated where cumulonimbus required part broadcast density hour an includes include laser ltlettergt textbased this runway approach phonetic acars point alphabet transmitted defense eg including be area cloud temporary ie wind code will lightning change reported service workload current when immediate that recording latest voice frequency alert vision given local busier additionally observation listen illumination progress contacting after such consisting optional information length datalink via help utc update of received recorded atc sky interface before which there is advisory identification terminal altimeter separate on datis electronic it alpha continuous essential break congestionin pilot exists display verify event accessed air informationmany cumulus automatic departure usually fixed 12 manpad significant at u temperature new a their use fm may all into or velocity every transmission airport contain displayed controller and icao atis if indicate spelling weather instrument taxiway appropriate unauthorized data system the condition important altitude interval realized surroundings to employ direction core available any obstruction active ha designation with name digitally relief through efb notams in dew	continuous broadcast of aeronautical information near airports	near aeronautical airport of information broadcast continuous	Airports
Aviation light signals	"<p>In the case of a radio failure or aircraft not equipped with a radio, or in the case of a deaf pilot, air traffic control may use a signal lamp (called a ""signal light gun"" or ""light gun"" by the FAA) to direct the aircraft. ICAO regulations require air traffic control towers to possess such signal lamps. The signal lamp has a focused bright beam and is capable of emitting three different colours: red, white and green. These colors may be flashed or steady, and have different meanings to aircraft in flight or on the ground. Planes can acknowledge the instruction by rocking their wings, moving the ailerons if on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during hours of darkness. Air Traffic Control signal light guns are typically specified with a (white) center beam brightness of &gt; 180,000 - 200,000 candela, and are visible for roughly 4 miles in clear daylight conditions. The table below describes the meaning of the signals.

Airport surveillance radar	<p>An <b>airport surveillance radar (ASR)</b> is a radar system used at airports to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the <i>terminal area</i>, the airspace around airports. It is the main air traffic control system for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport below an elevation of 25,000 feet. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems, the <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> surveillance radar. The primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface.

Engineered materials arrestor system	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>engineered materials arrestor system</b>, <b>engineered materials arresting system</b> (<b>EMAS</b>), or <b>arrester bed</b> is a bed of engineered materials built at the end of a runway to reduce the severity of the consequences of a runway excursion. Engineered materials are defined in FAA Advisory Circular No 150/5220-22B as ""high energy absorbing materials of selected strength, which will reliably and predictably crush under the weight of an aircraft"". While the current technology involves lightweight, crushable concrete blocks, any material that has been approved to meet the FAA Advisory Circular can be used for an EMAS. The purpose of an EMAS is to stop an aircraft overrun with no human injury and minimal aircraft damage. The aircraft is slowed by the loss of energy required to crush the EMAS material. An EMAS is similar in concept to the runaway truck ramp or race circuit gravel trap, made of gravel or sand. It is intended to stop an aircraft that has overshot a runway when there is an insufficient free space for a standard runway safety area (RSA). Multiple patents have been issued on the construction and design on the materials and process. </p><p>FAA Advisory Circular 150/5220-22B explains that an EMAS may not be effective for incidents involving aircraft of less than 11,000 kilograms (25,000 lb) weight. It also clarifies that an EMAS is not the same as a stopway, which is defined in FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13A, Section 312.</p><p>As of May 2017, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been working on developing a harmonized regulation regarding arresting systems. </p><p>Research projects completed in Europe have looked into the cost-effectiveness of EMAS. Arrestor beds have been installed at airports where the runway safety areas are below standards, and their ability to stop aircraft with minimal or no damage to the air frame and its occupants has proven to bring results far beyond the cost of installations. The latest report, ""Estimated Cost-Benefit Analysis of Runway Severity Reduction Based on Actual Arrestments"", shows how the money saved through the first 11 arrestments has reached a calculated total of 1.9 billion USD, thus saving more than $1 B over the estimated cost of development (R&amp;D, all installations worldwide, maintenance and repairs reaching a total of USD 600 million). The study suggests that mitigating the consequences of runway excursions worldwide may turn out to be much more cost-effective than the current focus on reducing the already very low probability of occurrence.</p>"	human selected costbenefit free 2017 construction aircraft more multiple patent proven turn also runaway used by costeffective 600 made lightweight overshot probability are mitigating intended 19 europe concept civil saving estimated emas material crush completed where required bed can involving rampd an 25000 low development runway loss effective gravel same be area stopway result installation built over for regarding much very project will installed minimal slowed when repair current overrun reducing that latest incident kilogram while million issued ability billion reached high 150530013a predictably arrestments injury approved rsa arrestor regulation money faa weight sand costeffectiveness below far reliably been clarifies aviation of section le thus severity circular suggests which 312as there truck is advisory engineered bring total already international strength analysis technology concrete on damage report explains occupant cost it end b focus organization similar space calculated out occurrence air based standard energy safety maintenance insufficient stop looked at frame 11 under a no their trap usd worldwide may beyond ramp all reduce consequence reaching into or saved 1 not airport have block and icao first meet research process developing reduction defined 11000 system arresting actual the excursion race to than circuit purpose show absorbing crushable any harmonized arrester how 150522022b ha involves with study working through lb in design	bed of engineered materials built at the end of a runway	the at runway engineered material end a of bed built	Airports

It opened on December 9, 2015. It makes Tijuana Airport a geographically binational airport. Unlike the binational airports serving the Swiss cities of Basel (entirely on French territory) and Geneva (entirely on Swiss territory), the CBX terminal is physically located in the United States but serves an airport whose main terminal and runways are in Mexico. A pedestrian bridge spans the United States–Mexico border, connecting passenger terminals between the two countries. It was the creation of Ralph Nieders, who introduced the concept and infrastructure design in Mexico City in 1989 and San Diego in 1990. The structural scheme allows passengers originating and destined to the United States direct access to the Tijuana airport and equally gives Mexican and international carriers operating from the Tijuana airport direct access to the U.S. passenger market. </p><p>The terminal, in the Otay Mesa neighborhood of San Diego, allows passengers to check in on the U.S. side of the U.S.–Mexico border, cross a 120-metre (390 ft) pedestrian/passenger bridge across the border, clear Mexican immigration and customs, and board flights at the Tijuana International Airport.

Airport	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>airport</b> is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation. </p><p>Operating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters. </p>"	restaurant control order number aircraft consists accessible more also sea surface extremely are large facility well other open can hub an employer includes adjacent runway hazard pollution bridge be including area for landing land hangar operating complex building change major service off that because local additionally effect support impact typically tourism tower take often regulation such them kind they experience larger complicated been aviation of thus infrastructure environmental contained site centre commercial which fixedbase traffic machinery both is terminal implemented apron particular source comprises plane space utility operator some operationally air maintain safety usually level at least u lounge general extended a disaster transit may mostly reduce caused within or noise monitor airport emergency aerially have and one weather taxiway rise serving acutely climate country system aerodrome the important to helipad measure active operation vulnerable heavy making with extreme in passenger transport	location where aircraft take off and land with extended support facilities, mostly for commercial air transport	location and for land mostly commercial facility take with extended air where aircraft support off transport	Airports
Airport malaria	<p><b>Airport malaria</b>, sometimes known as <b>baggage</b>, <b>luggage</b> or <b>suitcase</b> <b>malaria</b>, occurs when a malaria infected female <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito travels by aircraft from a country where malaria is common, arrives in a country where malaria is usually not found, and bites a person at or around the vicinity of the airport, or if the climate is suitable, travels in luggage and bites a person further away. The infected person usually presents with a fever in the absence of a recent travel history. There is often no suspicion of malaria, resulting in a delay in diagnosis and often death. Other causes of imported malaria need to be excluded first.</p><p>Most mosquitoes on aircraft do not carry malaria and the few that do are relatively inefficient invaders. The climate of the host country also offers natural protection. The detection and treatment is the same as of malaria in general.

The Kağıthane — Istanbul Airport portion of the line is currently planned to open in August 2022. </p><p>The purpose of this line is to provide direct and quick access from the Istanbul Airport in Arnavutköy to Levent, Istanbul's main commercial center and to Halkalı, the city's one of the most important train stations. Unlike other metro lines, the M11 will be a limited stop service, meaning that stations will be spaced further apart. This is most noticeable towards the line's southern ends, where the M11 will only have seven stations within Istanbul's urban area: Halkalı, Tema Park, Olimpiyat, Kayaşehir and Fenertepe in the west and Gayrettepe and Kağıthane in the east. </p><p>It will have two legs, one from Gayrettepe to Istanbul Airport line and the second from Halkalı to Istanbul Airport line. The first leg of the rapid transit line will be 37.2 km (23.1 mi) long with nine stations. The second leg of the line will be 31.5 km (19.6 mi) long with seven stations, in a total of 69 km (43 mi) with sixteen stations. The travel time between the end stations will be 60 minutes at a maximum speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). The line will run through five districts of Istanbul, Şişli, Eyüp, Arnavutköy, Başakşehir and Küçükçekmece. It is expected that the line will carry annually around 94 million passengers. The M11 line will connect to other rapid transit lines: Marmaray, M1, M2, M3, M7 (twice), M9 and at the airport to the high-speed train line.</p><p>The investment budget of the construction is € 999.8 million.

Arlanda Express	<p><b>Arlanda Express</b> is an airport rail link connecting Stockholm Central Station with the Stockholm Arlanda Airport outside Stockholm, Sweden. Operated by <b>A-Train AB</b>, the trip takes 20 minutes and runs four to six times per hour using seven X3 electric multiple units. The services operate over the East Coast and Arlanda Lines calling at Stockholm Central, Arlanda North and Arlanda South stations. The service was used by 2.7 million passengers in 2007 and by 3.3 million passengers in 2012.</p><p>Planning of the airport link started in the 1980s. In 1993 the Government of Sweden issued a tender for a public–private partnership (PPP) to build the Arlanda Line. The construction of the line was subsidized with a combination of some state grants and large state loans. The successful tenderer would receive a monopoly on traffic between the airport and Stockholm until 2040. The line and the services were inaugurated on 25 November 1999. The PPP contract has since been criticized for being unclear, uneconomical for the state and leading to a low utilization of the service as ticket prices are very expensive at 300 SEK (around 30 EUR) for an adult single ticket on the very short journey. The railroad is owned by two Australian pension funds and partly (37.5%) by the Gingko Tree Investment Ltd, a subsidiary of Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange.</p>	investment operated minute run construction successful multiple atrain sweden short would between time used by monopoly seven 300 are eur 33 public–private large link express unit tree utilization central tender x3 wa hour an low connecting since leading partly over for single rail per were 375 very service 25 contract million issued foreign 2007 expensive 2012planning stockholm take east two until started ab inaugurated operate tenderer been of six traffic calling is 30 uneconomical ticket subsidiary grant on four 1980s trip gingko south combination outside government chinese line subsidized around station electric november some coast partnership state at loan unclear a ltd build being using 20 criticized owned 1993 airport and receive sek exchange arlanda 2040 the to fund pension journey 1999 railroad adult ppp ha 27 with australian price north administration in passenger	Train connection between Stockholm City and Arlanda Airport	and train between stockholm city arlanda airport connection	Airports

Gardermoen Line	"<p>The <b>Gardermoen Line</b> (Norwegian: <i lang=""no"">Gardermobanen</i>) is a high-speed railway line between Oslo and Eidsvoll, Norway, running past Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The line is 64 kilometres (40 mi) long and replaced the older Hoved Line as the main line north-east of Oslo. The older Hoved Line now handles commuter and freight traffic, while the Gardermoen Line handles high-speed passenger trains and freight trains laden with jet fuel for the airport. Both lines are owned by Bane NOR. </p><p>The line was opened in 1998, at the same time as the airport that gave the line its name. It is used by the Flytoget airport express train service as well as express trains by Vy. It is the only high-speed railway in Norway, with a maximum permitted speed of 210 km/h (130 mph).

List of shortest runways	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>This is a <b>list of the shortest airport runways</b> in the world. While most modern commercial aircraft require a paved runway of at least 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in length, many early aircraft were designed to operate from unprepared strips that could be improvised in small spaces. Los Angeles's Grand Central Airport, considered a landmark in aviation history, had a 1,200-foot (370 m) runway during its first six years of operation from 1923 to 1929. Such airstrips were used by heavy as well as light aircraft. During the Doolittle Raid in WW II, twin-engine B-25 bombers with a loaded weight of seventeen tons took off from the 827-foot (252 m) flight deck of the carrier USS <i>Hornet</i>. As late as 1977 a Lockheed Constellation demonstrated its ability to use the 2,700-foot (820 m) runway of the Greenwood Lake Airport in New Jersey, and in 1946, a lightened Constellation took off from a grass strip in 2,000 feet (600 m) on only three engines. Most general aviation aircraft retain this short-field performance; the Cessna 172, the most produced aircraft in history, will take off in as little as 720 feet (220 m) when fully loaded. Many small airfields capable of accommodating these types remain in use, mostly in remote areas in the American West and the French Alps, where space is limited. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1444 Cached time: 20220514094756 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [] CPU time usage: 0.156 seconds Real time usage: 0.205 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 361/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 4282/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 444/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 415/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.062/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 2957829/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 178.899 1 -total 50.43% 90.218 1 Template:Short_description 25.05% 44.812 1 Template:Pagetype 23.52% 42.083 1 Template:Expand_list 21.83% 39.057 6 Template:Convert 21.45% 38.380 3 Template:Main_other 10.35% 18.510 1 Template:SDcat 9.20% 16.460 1 Template:Ambox 8.75% 15.651 1 Template:TDMCA 7.49% 13.397 1 Template:DMCA -->"	loaded these jersey american most lockheed aircraft us type had early history used by 252 600 1977 1200foot raid well paved airfield from where central 1946 220 this runway los french designed be area lightened were many will remain 370 when seventeen that 6000 off hornet could took while produced ability 720 carrier ii small light deck shortest take alp such length weight ww late operate aviation year of three 2000 six 2700foot commercial 1800 b25 is twinengine engine strip west on list lake fully it modern landmark space 172 doolittle at least performance new general a use remote considered mostly flight capable limited ton 820 airstrip airport improvised 1923 and first grass greenwood cessna the foot unprepared to world retain constellation during 827foot only bomber shortfield accommodating angeless operation m 1929 heavy demonstrated little with require grand in	List	list	Airports

Domestic airport	"<p>A <b>domestic airport</b> is an airport that handles only domestic flights—flights within the same country.

Security check / metal detectors are used in most countries, but in many cases they were installed decades after security checks for international flights had become commonplace. </p><p>Most municipal airports in Canada and the United States are of this classification. At international airports in Canada, there are domestic terminals that handle flights within Canada (flying from one Canadian city to another). </p><p>Additionally, some airports that are named ""international"" are essentially domestic airports that handles international traffic on an irregular basis.

Relief airport	<p>A <b>relief airport</b> or <b>reliever airport</b> is an airport that is built or designated to provide relief or additional capacity to an area when the primary commercial airport(s) requires additional capacity, on a long-term or temporary basis. Reliever airports may also relieve the need for capacity by relocating non-jet general aviation activity from a commercial airport to a different facility. By removing aircraft with lower capacities and slower speeds, the commercial service airport is able to operate more flights with larger aircraft and handle more passengers increasing the efficiency with minimal additional cost in facilities. This also spreads out the aircraft over a wider area generally improving air traffic in the entire community. </p><p>In the USA, for an airport to qualify as a FAA-designated reliever, it must have 100 or more based aircraft or 25,000 annual itinerant operations.</p>	aircraft more able also by additional increasing facility must from an 25000 longterm this basis over area temporary built for minimal when activity service that relieve usa provide efficiency faadesignated need relocating larger operate aviation generally 100 entire commercial lower traffic is handle nonjet on cost designated it removing qualify out different air slower based speed community requires general a reliever primary may flight or airport have and spread capacity wider the itinerant to improving operation with relief annual in passenger	airport made to add additional capacity	additional to made add airport capacity	Airports

Ohio State University Airport	<p><span></span> </p> <p><b>Ohio State University Airport</b> (IATA: <b>OSU</b>, ICAO: <b>KOSU</b>, FAA LID: <b>OSU</b>) is a public airport six miles (10 km) northwest of downtown Columbus, in Franklin County, Ohio, United States. It is owned and operated by Ohio State University in Columbus, not to be confused with Ohio University in Athens, which owns the Ohio University Airport (IATA: <b>ATO</b>, ICAO: <b>KUNI</b>, FAA LID: <b>UNI</b>). It is also known as the <b>OSU Don Scott Airport</b>, named after Donald E. Scott, an OSU alumnus who died during his training as a pilot in the United Kingdom during World War II. </p><p>The Ohio State University Airport serves the university while offering general aviation services for the public. </p><p>The OSU Airport began in 1943 as a flight training facility for military and civilian pilots, operated by the OSU School of Aviation. The OSU Airport is now a self-supporting entity of The Ohio State University through the Department of Aerospace Engineering &amp; Aviation. </p><p>The Department oversees all aspects of the Airport from Airport Management, to Fixed-Base Operations, to Airport Maintenance. </p><p>The OSU Airport is a Part 139 Certificated Airport, serving as a general aviation reliever for the nearby John Glenn Columbus International Airport. </p><p>The OSU Airport is home to 160 aircraft, including single- and multi-engine, piston, and turbine engine aircraft and rotorcraft. It oversees about 71,000 operations per year and generally ranks in the top five airports in Ohio in the number of take-offs and landings with Cleveland Hopkins, John Glenn Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati Lunken. </p><p>The Airport is also home to the OSU Department of Aerospace Engineering &amp; Aviation Gas Turbine Laboratory, several facilities operated by the OSU College of Agriculture, the Ohio Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation, fourteen corporate flight departments, and four flying clubs. </p><p>In 1967 the crew of a TWA 707 mistook the Ohio State University Airport for Port Columbus International Airport (now known as John Glenn Columbus International Airport). After shuttling all passengers and baggage to Port Columbus, and removing all galley equipment and seats, the plane was light enough to depart for the larger airport across town.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1383 Cached time: 20220514111023 Cache expiry: 0 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.389 seconds Real time usage: 0.476 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 2113/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 40510/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1864/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 15/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 4636/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.209/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 4906001/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 442.421 1 -total 39.36% 174.156 1 Template:Infobox_airport 38.28% 169.349 2 Template:Infobox 20.25% 89.610 1 Template:Cite_web 15.01% 66.394 1 Template:Short_description 11.50% 50.892 1 Template:More_citations_needed 10.11% 44.729 1 Template:Ambox 8.28% 36.627 1 Template:Coord 8.13% 35.947 1 Template:Pagetype 7.88% 34.845 2 Template:Infobox_airport/datatable -->	operated 1943 department number flying aircraft lid lunken confused also iata by office laboratory depart uni kingdom engineering university facility county who from crew part aspect enough wa an be including seat athens town several for single ato per landing 160 training service war school club while agriculture ii galley serf light college corporate five kuni oversees after 71000 faa baggage larger aviation donald of year generally twa six 707 passenger fixedbase franklin km which transportation is aerospace international now engine four columbus equipment it 1967 removing nearby e selfsupporting plane pilot his about takeoff shuttling cincinnati turbine maintenance state downtown named entity john general osu a mistook reliever mile ohio flight all northwest don kosu public management 10 owned not airport multiengine began offering top and icao died civilian 139 known serving rank united the hopkins to alumnus world gas during certificated fourteen home piston amp port dayton scott operation glenn cleveland with across owns military through in rotorcraft	airport in Columbus, United States of America	state columbus america airport of in united	Airports

She was initially trained by the pianist and composer Johann Peter Pixis who adopted her when she was 15 but also studied with Henriette Sontag and Ferdinando Paer. She made her concert debut in London in 1833 and her operatic debut in 1834 in Karlsruhe. She subsequently sang in Vienna, Paris, London, and Italy both on the opera stage and in successful concert tours with her adoptive father. In Italy she made her La Scala debut in 1838 in the title role of Rossini's <i>La Cenerentola</i> and also sang at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and the Teatro Massimo in Palermo. In 1840 she created the title role in Giovanni Pacini's <i>Saffo</i>, which he wrote expressly for her voice. Pixis married a Sicilian nobleman, Giovanni di Sant'Onofrio del Castillo, in 1843 and retired from the stage three years later.

His stained glass works also feature in St Anne's Church, Brown Edge, Staffordshire Moorlands, and St Edward the Confessor church at Cheddleton Staffordshire.

Antoni Gaudí	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Antoni Gaudí i Cornet</b> (<span></span>; <small>Catalan: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ənˈtɔni ɣəwˈði]</span>; 25 June 1852 – 10 June 1926) was a Catalan architect from Spain known as the greatest exponent of Catalan Modernism. Gaudí's works have a highly individualized, <i>sui generis</i> style. Most are located in Barcelona, including his main work, the church of the Sagrada Família. </p><p>Gaudí's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as <i>trencadís</i> which used waste ceramic pieces. </p><p>Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí became part of the <i>Modernista</i> movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream <i>Modernisme</i>, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and moulding the details as he conceived them. </p><p>Gaudí's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects.

List of works by Jean Metzinger	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>This is an incomplete <b>list of works</b> by the French modern artist Jean Metzinger (June 24, 1883 – November 3, 1956). He is admired as a painter, theorist, writer, critic and poet. </p><p>Between 1902 and 1907 Metzinger worked in a combination of Neo-Impressionist, Divisionist and Fauvist styles. A Cézannian component in his work during this phase produced some of the earliest proto-Cubist works. </p><p>In the words of S.E. Johnson, an in-depth analysis of Metzinger's Pre-Cubist period—his first artistic peak—""can only class that painter, in spite of his youth, as being already one of the leading artistic personalities in that period directly preceding Cubism. [...] In an attempt to understand the importance of Jean Metzinger in Modern Art, we could limit ourselves to three considerations. Firstly, there is the often overlooked importance of Metzinger's Divisionist Period of 1900–1908. Secondly, there is the role of Metzinger in the founding of the Cubist School. Thirdly, there is the consideration of Metzinger's whole Cubist Period from 1909 to 1930. In taking into account these various factors, we can understand why Metzinger must be included among that small group of artists who have taken a part in the shaping of Art History in the first half of the Twentieth Century.""</p><p>From 1908 Metzinger experimented with the faceting of form, a style that would soon become known as Cubism.

Hedgebrook	"<p><b>Hedgebrook</b> is a rural retreat for women writers on Whidbey Island, Washington, founded in 1988. Hedgebrook's artist-in-residence program accepts up to 80 writers each year, who spend two to four weeks in residence working on their diverse writing projects. Each writer stays in her own hand-crafted cottage. Room and board are provided at no cost to the writers-in-residence. The retreat is a working farm, offering organic produce for the writers, and communal dinners each night prepared by in-house chefs.</p><p>Hedgebrook's global community of alumnae, more than 2,000 writers from all over the world, include celebrated author Gloria Steinem, poets Naomi Shihab Nye, Suheir Hammad, playwrights Dael Orlandersmith, Ellen McLaughlin, and Eve Ensler, novelists Nassim Assefi, Bernardine Evaristo, Sarah Ladipo Manyika, Mary Gordon, Ruth Ozeki, Elizabeth George, and Sarah Waters, memoirists Honor Moore and Carolyn Forché, non-fiction writers Pramila Jayapal and Holly Morris, and solo performer Sarah Jones. </p><p>Hedgebrook's Radical Craft Classes offer women writers the unique opportunity to study with renowned women writers such as Jane Hamilton, Theresa Rebeck, Karen Joy Fowler, Victoria Redel, Claire Dederer and Robin Swicord. The week-long writing workshops, offered in a variety of genres (fiction, memoir, playwriting, screenwriting, poetry), focus on different aspects of the writer's craft and process. </p><p>The annual Hedgebrook Women Playwrights Festival (HWPF) celebrates the work of women writing for the theatre. Since the festival’s inauguration in 1998, HWPF has supported the work of an impressive array of women playwrights and served an important role in the development of new plays by women. The festival begins with a ""pre-retreat"" weekend, in which the playwrights have the opportunity to get to know one another, hear each other’s plays read aloud, and share responses with an intimate group of theatre professionals in a relaxed, convivial atmosphere. This is followed by a two-week retreat at Hedgebrook, where each playwright has her own private cottage, a dramaturg on-call, and the opportunity to work in Hedgebrook’s unique combination of solitude and community. The retreat is capped off with public presentations of excerpts from each play. </p><p>Participation in the Hedgebrook Women Playwrights Festival is by invitation in collaboration with partner theatres from around the country. In recognition of the fact that fewer than 20% of the plays produced each year on US stages are by women, Hedgebrook is partnering with theatres who show their commitment to women playwrights through commissions, development and production opportunities.

Newlyn School	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Newlyn School</b> was an art colony of artists based in or near Newlyn, a fishing village adjacent to Penzance, on the south coast of Cornwall, from the 1880s until the early twentieth century. The establishment of the Newlyn School was reminiscent of the Barbizon School in France, where artists fled Paris to paint in a more pure setting emphasising natural light. These schools along with a related California movement were also known as En plein air. </p><p>Some of the first British artists to settle in the area had already travelled in Brittany, but found in Newlyn a comparable English environment with a number of things guaranteed to attract them: fantastic light, cheap living, and the availability of inexpensive models. The artists were fascinated by the fishermen's working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages. Some paintings showed the hazards and tragedy of the community's life, such as women anxiously looking out to sea as the boats go out, or a young woman crying on hearing news of a disaster. Walter Langley is generally recognised as the pioneer of the Newlyn art colony and Stanhope Forbes, who settled there in 1884, as the father of it. The later Forbes School of Painting, founded by Forbes and his wife Elizabeth in 1899, promoted the study of figure painting. A present-day Newlyn School of Art was formed in 2011 with Arts Council funding providing art courses taught by many of the best-known artists working in Cornwall today. </p><p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Lamorna, a nearby fishing village to the south, became popular with artists of the Newlyn School and is particularly associated with the artist S.

Jerome, Arizona	"<p><b>Jerome</b> is a town in the Black Hills of Yavapai County in the U.S. state of Arizona. Founded in the late 19th century on Cleopatra Hill overlooking the Verde Valley, Jerome is located more than 5,000 feet (1,500 m) above sea level. It is about 100 miles (160 km) north of Phoenix along State Route 89A between Sedona and Prescott. Supported in its heyday by rich copper mines, it was home to more than 10,000 people in the 1920s. As of the 2010 census, its population was 444. It is now known for its tourist attractions, such as its ""ghost town"" status and local wineries.</p><p>The town owes its existence mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 1.75<span> </span>billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano. Tectonic plate movements, plate collisions, uplift, deposition, erosion, and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface, both near Jerome. In the late 19th century, the United Verde Mine, developed by William A. Clark, extracted ore bearing copper, gold, silver, and other metals from the larger of the two. The United Verde Extension UVX Mine, owned by James Douglas Jr., depended on the other huge deposit. In total, the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of Jerome were among the richest ever found. </p><p>Jerome made news in 1917 when labor unrest involving the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again during and after the Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed for good in 1953, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21st century, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history. </p>"	loaded i restaurant depended above phoenix closed rich house douglas more thereafter gold century subject located fell between sedona early had history sea by surface pushed made sale uplift verde always 1953 historic census other county bearing attraction movement member heyday from 10000 who overlooking dwindled wa involving an vicinity great turned 89a volcano news gallery industrial jr town national for formed were mine 160 park mining ring when that fluctuation arizona war population production near william plate became exposed deposition local car among yavapai billion ore tourism james eventually along after route such two hill silver close unrest 21st 1500 ghost resident late larger coffee year iww of retail 100 led undersea 60 collision km 1917 founded both then is total 175 ran now valley tip on west effort good prescott it erosion 1967 cleopatra 5000 museum landmark metal 19th tectonic ever about 2010 owes tourist out uvx extension labor state level at u mainly cattle geologic supported oblivion succeeded devoted a fault expulsion art mile 1920s caldera discovered found huge owned and extracted ago deposit one fewer process shipped known richest united the 444 wineriesthe foot than to worker existence body world during home black jerome again developed m clark copper people rose gunpoint north depression status in boomed save	town in Arizona, United States	arizona state in town united	Artists

Art colony	<p>An <b>art colony,</b> also known as an <b>artists' colony,</b> can be defined two ways. Its most liberal description refers to the organic congregation of artists in towns, villages and rural areas, often drawn by areas of natural beauty, the prior existence of other artists or art schools there, and a lower cost of living. More commonly, the term refers to the guest-host model of a mission-driven planned community, which administers a formal process for awarding artist residencies. In the latter case, a typical mission might include providing artists with the time, space and support to create; fostering community among artists; and providing arts education (lectures, workshops) to the public. Early 20th century American guest-host models include New Hampshire's MacDowell Colony and New York's Yaddo. </p><p>World-wide, the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are Res Artis, in Amsterdam, and the Alliance of Artists Communities, in Providence, Rhode Island.

Barbizon school	"<p>The <b>Barbizon school</b> of painters were part of an art movement towards Realism in art, which arose in the context of the dominant Romantic Movement of the time. The Barbizon school was active roughly from 1830 through 1870. It takes its name from the village of Barbizon, France, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where many of the artists gathered. Most of their works were landscape painting, but several of them also painted landscapes with farmworkers, and genre scenes of village life. Some of the most prominent features of this school are its tonal qualities, color, loose brushwork, and softness of form.</p><p>The leaders of the Barbizon school were: Théodore Rousseau, Charles-François Daubigny, Jules Dupré, Constant Troyon, Charles Jacque, and Narcisse Virgilio Díaz. Jean-François Millet lived in Barbizon from 1849, but his interest in figures with a landscape backdrop sets him rather apart from the others. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was the earliest on the scene, first painting in the forest in 1829, but British art historian Harold Osborne suggested that “his work has a poetic and literary quality which sets him somewhat apart"". Other artists associated with the school, often pupils of the main group, include: Henri Harpignies, Albert Charpin, François-Louis Français, and Émile van Marcke. </p><p>Many of the artists were also printmakers, mostly in etching but the group also provided the bulk of the artists using the semiphotographic cliché verre technique.

Le Plateau-Mont-Royal	"<p><b>Le Plateau-Mont-Royal</b> (<small>French pronunciation: ​</small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[lə plato mɔ̃ ʁwajal]</span>) is a borough (<i>arrondissement</i>) of the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. </p><p>The Plateau-Mont-Royal takes its name from its location on a plateau, on the eastern side of Mont-Royal and overlooking downtown Montreal, across it's southern border. The borough is bordered to the south by Sherbrooke Street; to the north and north-east by the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks; and to the west by Hutchison (north of Mount Royal Avenue), Park Avenue (between Mount Royal and Pine Avenue) and University Street (south of Pine Avenue). It is the most densely populated borough in Canada, with 101,054 people living in an 8.1 square kilometre (3¼ sq. mi.) area. </p><p>There is a difference between the borough, Plateau-Mont-Royal—a political division of the City of Montreal—and the neighbourhood referred to as ""the Plateau"". The borough includes not only the Plateau proper, but also the neighbourhoods of Mile End (bounded by Avenue du Mont-Royal to the south and the Avenue Henri-Julien to the east) and Milton Park (bounded by University, Sherbrooke, Saint-Laurent and Pine). Both neighbourhoods are generally considered distinct from the Plateau. </p><p>The Plateau is famous for being a major center for the arts, with a large concentration of artists, musicians, and creative organizations. Many artistic institutions are established in the Plateau such as the National Theatre School of Canada, the Quebec Conservatory of Music in Montreal, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and many theater such as le Rideau vert, le Théâtre de Quat'Sous, La Licorne and le Théâtre d'Aujourd'hui. The Plateau has many Parcs such as Jeanne-Mance park, La Fontaine park, Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier park, Saint-Louis Square, and Gérald-Godin plaza.

Art commune	<p>An <b>art commune</b> is a communal living situation or commune where collective art is produced as a function of the group's activities. Contemporary art communes are scattered around the world, yet frequently aloof to widespread attention due to displeasure or discomfort with mainstream society. In the 1960s and 1970s art communes such as Friedrichshof (also known as Aktionsanalytische Organisation) flourished. Creative art was enthusiastically produced within such groups, which became gathering points for the counterculture movement. </p><p>From a sociological viewpoint the art producing communes of the 1970s failed to sustain themselves, owing largely to the fact that they tended to have open memberships, which eventually attracted people with social problems. These problems then spread and become too difficult for these autonomous entities to handle, although some groups, such as the former Kunsthaus Tacheles, continued to flourish. </p><p>Today's art communes are a mix of artists, drifters, collectivists, activists, dadaists, and hangers on. Such groups are more politically and ideologically diverse than their mid-20th century counterparts, which has led to many art communes becoming more mainstream commercial entities. </p>	continued these mix collectivist more century producing sustain also scattered society become are group fact largely situation flourish movement social where from activist open wa ideologically an due point autonomous too owing for former many diverse attention activity that tended widespread mid20th yet mainstream produced friedrichshof eventually drifter such living politically communal flourished collective they commune of themselves aloof led commercial which viewpoint function creative then is handle today gathering on counterculture aktionsanalytische around frequently some difficult dadaists entity discomfort a their art problem kunsthaus within hanger or enthusiastically contemporary displeasure sociological have and 1970s organisation attracted spread although known the 1960s membership artist than to world counterpart becoming failed tacheles people ha with became in	communal living situation focused on art creation	on communal situation creation focused living art	Artists

Some studios have 18-foot (5.5 m) ceilings with double-height spaces, while others are smaller units that occupy part of a single floor. Artists generally rented the studios as a combination residence and working space. </p><p>The Gainsborough Studios corporation built the structure between 1907 and 1908 as artists' cooperative housing, although it gradually became a standard residential development.

Fort Worth Circle	"<p>The <b>Fort Worth Circle</b> was a progressive art colony in Fort Worth, Texas. The colony was active during the 1940s and much of the 1950s and formed around younger artists, most of them native Texans under-30, who embraced themes not traditionally seen in Texas art up to that time. Through exhibitions and modest publicity these artists built statewide reputations during and after World War II as proponents of modern art. Social compatibility and shared affinities for modern art and classical music provided common ground among members of the circle and contributed to the group's cohesion. Within the circle's original membership, male and female artists were almost equally represented. </p><p>After World War II the Fort Worth Circle's influence expanded as younger artists became associated with the group and older members who no longer lived in Fort Worth retained their ties. Additionally, at the conclusion of World War II the ranks of Fort Worth's art community swelled with the return of artists who had served in the military. Some of these returning artists also became identified with the Fort Worth Circle. Membership changed over time, but the ""backbone"" of the colony consisted of Bill Bomar, Cynthia Brants, Veronica Helfensteller, Dickson Reeder, Flora Blanc Reeder, and Bror Utter.</p><p>The colony's presence was acknowledged by Dallas newspaper critic John Rosenfield in 1948 when he observed that a ""school"" of modern artists was at work in neighboring Fort Worth. Based on Rosenfield's characterization, the colony was long referred to by local residents as the Fort Worth School. Over time, ""Fort Worth Circle"" has replaced ""Fort Worth School"" as a more accurate summation of the colony's true nature. </p>"	helfensteller texas these younger observed most embraced more had reeder time also by summation native music served group dickson member who social tie returning shared backbone traditionally return wa referred lived presence he ground cohesion over built nature for colony formed were bill male much flora when that older publicity dallas war school local among blanc ii additionally compatibility almost veronica classical equally after them up under30 changed conclusion seen resident accurate 1940s represented of circle modest rosenfields identified critic brant but newspaper replaced worth on modern utterthe texan affinity true around theme some influence progressive 1950s proponent statewide based community bomar original at john rosenfield expanded a no their swelled art contributed long characterization retained within provided not consisted fort and acknowledged work 1948 bror rank neighboring the cynthia membership artist to world common during longer active female ha with military through associated became in reputation exhibition	Progressive art colony in Fort Worth, Texas	worth colony texas progressive art fort in	Artists
Edendale, Los Angeles	"<p><b>Edendale</b> is a historical name for a district in Los Angeles, California, northwest of Downtown Los Angeles, in what is known today as Echo Park, Los Feliz and Silver Lake. In the opening decades of the 20th century, in the era of silent movies, Edendale was known as the home of most major movie studios on the West Coast. Among its many claims, it was home to the Keystone Kops, and the site of many movie firsts, including Charlie Chaplin's first movie, the first feature-length comedy, and the first pie-in-the-face. The Edendale movie studios were mostly concentrated in a four-block stretch of Allesandro Street, between Berkeley Avenue and Duane Street. Allesandro Street was later renamed Glendale Boulevard (and a smaller nearby street took on the name Allesandro). </p><p>Edendale's hilly streets and nearby lake lent themselves to many silent movie gags. The district's heyday as the center of the motion picture industry was in the 1910s. By the 1920s, the studios had moved elsewhere, mostly to Hollywood, which would come to supplant it as the ""movie capital of the world"".</p><p>In the years prior to World War II, Edendale had a large artist community and a large communist community. Many of its residents were transplants from the Eastern United States or the Soviet Union.</p><p>Edendale was known as such at least until 1940, as the Pacific Electric Railway operated an Edendale Line of its ""red cars"" that ran the 5-mile (8.0 km) course between Downtown Los Angeles and the top of Edendale. The red car ran down the median of Allesandro Avenue (Glendale Blvd.), which was double-tracked, and even triple-tracked between Sunset and Effie, as the tracks were also used by the interurban Glendale-Burbank Line. After 1940, the Edendale Line as such ceased, though service continued in the form of local service on the Glendale-Burbank Line. Rail service on that line ended completely in 1955, and the tracks have been abandoned. Soon after, the region was cut in two by the construction of the Glendale Freeway. </p><p>The name Edendale is no longer used as a place name, and is little known today. A few remnants of the name are the local post office (officially called Edendale Station), a public library branch, an urban farm called Edendale Farm and a restaurant called Edendale. Although many of the structures from the 1910s remain and can be identified by careful comparison with old photos, this district today is located in an unremarkable commercial zone called the ""Glendale Boulevard Corridor,"" which is known mostly for its function as a commuter thoroughfare between the southern end of the Glendale Freeway and downtown Los Angeles.

Talashkino	"<p><b>Talashkino</b> (Russian: <span lang=""ru"">Талашкино</span>) is a selo in Smolensky District, Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located 18 kilometres (11 mi) southeast of Smolensk. Talashkino is notable because in the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century it belonged to Princess Maria Tenisheva, who created here an artistic colony. The buildings of the estate are currently split between Talashkino and a nearby village, Flyonovo. </p><p>Tenisheva, sponsored by her husband, Vladimir Tenishev, bought the estate in 1893. She lived in Saint Petersburg, was educated as an artist, was acquainted with many contemporary artists, and since 1894 run a free art studio in her house, supervised by Ilya Repin, the most influential Russian painter. She was also an art collector, and in 1898 she donated all of her collection to the Russian Museum. In 1900, she opened an artisan workshop, which mainly produced ceramic and carving, and invited Sergey Malyutin to supervise it. The objective of Tenisheva was to create a ""genuine Russian style"". Apprentices, selected by Malyutin, were local peasants. Malyutin stayed in Talashkino until 1903, and in the meanwhile designed a house in Flyonovo based on Russian fairy tales. After 1903, the workshop was taken over by Alexey Zinovyev and Vladimir Beketov, who were both under influence of Nicholas Roerich. The production of the workshop was exhibited all over Russia on a regular basis; in 1902, there was a large exhibition of Talashkino products in Smolensk. Tenisheva also asked a photographer, Ivan Barshchevsky, to organize a historical museum in Talashkino, with the purpose of educating local peasants. The museum has proven to be too big and was in 1905 relocated to Smolensk. Tenisheva organized a theater and a balalaika orchestra (conducted by Vasily Lidin) in Talashkino as well. A number of Russian painters visited Tenisheva in Talashkino, including Ilya Repin, Konstantin Korovin, Mikhail Vrubel, and Nicolas Roerich.</p><p>In 1919, Tenisheva left Russia, and the estate was nationalized and decayed.

Rocky Neck, Gloucester	<p><b>Rocky Neck</b> is one of the oldest continuously operating art colonies in the United States. Located on a rocky peninsula within Gloucester's working harbor, Rocky Neck is known for its quaint neighborhood, geographic beauty and many art galleries and studios. </p><p>Artists including Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, and many others working on Rocky Neck in the 19th and early 20th centuries inspired the Cape Ann style of American Impressionism.

Blu (artist)	<p><b>Blu</b> is the pseudonym of an Italian artist who conceals his real identity. He was born in Senigallia. He lives in Bologna and has been active in street art since 1999. </p><p>His early career involved the practice of shared artistic actions. Artists such as Dem, Sweza, Run and, above all, Ericailcane, were his companions during nocturnal raids where an anonymous creative participation overcame the need of signing their pieces. Also, during those years, Blu started experimenting with digital animation, and he created short interactive video clips that were used as a visual contribution to the live musical performances of the collective OK NO.</p><p>The collaboration with Ericailcane had its best results from 2003 to 2006. The two personalities complemented each other; while Blu was painting his characteristic human figures Ericailcane made his typical animals. The two artists, friends in real life, continue to work together, although less often. </p><p>Starting in 2004, some art galleries noticed Blu's artistic value and invited him to take part in both one-man and collective shows. Yet Blu, throughout his entire youthful career, attempted to limit his presence within the official art world, preferring other kinds of territories. </p><p>Since his major pieces outside of his videos have been immovable murals, the survey below of Blu's work is geographical rather than chronological. </p>	geographical above human run throughout identity had digital short early sweza real also used made oneman invited street characteristic raid other who visual territory where from mural shared ok part wa complemented an live since chronological he gallery presence clip born result were limit those companion major best that involved blu survey yet each while 2006 together contribution take often need such two kind started 2004 collective below experimenting youthful interactive been collaboration year of action le preferring continue video entire friend attempted both creative him is rather career overcame it noticed outside life his piece value official immovable figure some nothe performance animation a their animal created art signing all within have and artistic practice work nocturnal although senigallia 2003 bologna personality participation the starting ericailcane musical artist than dem to world blus during anonymous 1999 typical show active italian pseudonym conceals ha with in painting	Italian artist	italian artist	Artists

His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls and bridges throughout the world.

Geminus started work in England by working with Thomas Raynalde and producing ""<i>The byrth of Mankinde</i>"" aka ""<i>The Woman's booke</i>"" in 1545. </p><p>""<i>The byrth of Mankinde</i>"", was the best English language reference work on midwifery in the 1500s. Its text was translated from Eucharius Rösslin's ""<i>Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten</i>"". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus’s ""<i>Compendiosa</i>"".</p><p>The ""<i>Compendiosa totius anatomie</i>"" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to Edward VI. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of Adam and Eve; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by Vesalius. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of ""unlatined Surgeons"". He had employed Nicholas Udall, the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of Henri de Mondeville's ""Surgery"". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). </p><p>In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. Jacques Grévin, the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569. Watermarks suggest that the plates for the 1564 Paris edition were printed in London and then transported to Paris. </p>"	illustration translate vi spain translation france 1562 care sheet delineation had early writer producing description also by book surgery 1510 unlatined removed happened success large superfluous delineatio background birth lambert other version who regarded from watermark part schwangern wa benefit an playwright vesalius aka edward compendiosathe great he next landscape french be distributed taken for edition were many midwifery 1565 london engraver copperplate best english that 1545 henri following exarata 5 1569 later copy plate raynalde produced while 1500s lille s richard woodcut thomas 16 nicholas lambritthomas herford complete after booke two jonas medical fertility printed der paris started infant udall via mondevilles been year of anatomie frauwen 100 entire eye three 1553 1540 appeared which there flemish latin then eve addition grévin discussed germany anatomical engraved transported on external brain 6 matter it rosengarten print saw 1559 ever his woman noted some wrote translated 4 text england byrth surgeon refugee john printing 1564 ’ aere done a geminuss unnumbered may geminus all 41 skeleton compendiosa adam consisted image reference and rösslins hebammen one first notably work totius und mankinde employed eucharius engraving physician organ artery second country anatomy vein the nerve informed de to muscle italy jacques 3 poet available again 1540s printer active dedicated pseudonym language foldout copper with pregnancy working suggest enjoyed in detail	Flemish engraver and printer	and printer engraver flemish	Artists

Hergé	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Georges Prosper Remi</b> (<small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ʁəmi]</span>; 22 May 1907 – 3 March 1983), known by the pen name <b>Hergé</b> (<span></span>; <small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ɛʁʒe]</span>), from the French pronunciation of his reversed initials <i>RG</i>, was a Belgian cartoonist. He is best known for creating <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i>, the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, <i>Quick &amp; Flupke</i> (1930–1940) and <i>The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko</i> (1936–1957). His works were executed in his distinct <i>ligne claire</i> drawing style. </p><p>Born to a lower-middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, <i>The Adventures of Totor</i>, for <i>Le Boy-Scout Belge</i> in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper <i>Le Vingtième Siècle</i>, he created <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i> in 1929 on the advice of its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early installments — <i>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</i>, <i>Tintin in the Congo</i>, and <i>Tintin in America</i> — were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the <i>Quick &amp; Flupke</i> and <i>Jo, Zette and Jocko</i> series for <i>Le Vingtième Siècle</i>. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from <i>The Blue Lotus</i> onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, <i>Le Vingtième Siècle</i> was closed, but Hergé continued his series in <i>Le Soir</i>, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration. </p><p>After the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, <i>Le Soir</i> was shut down and its staff — including Hergé — accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and although no charges were brought against Hergé, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With Raymond Leblanc he established <i>Tintin</i> magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new <i>Adventures of Tintin</i> stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as Edgar P. Jacobs' <i>Blake and Mortimer</i>. In 1950 he established Studios Hergé as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members Jacques Martin and Bob de Moor greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i>. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced <i>Tintin in Tibet</i>, his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an abstract artist. </p><p>Hergé's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. He is widely celebrated in Belgium: a Hergé Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009. </p> "	continued illustration remains wellknown family staff closed most chongren meticulous etterbeek successful blake radio pronunciation cartoonist century 1930–1940 editor p early prolific norbert realism also clarity by hergés book favourite occupation adaptation medium are controlled domestically collaborator distinct continuing charge europe background conservative other propaganda comic subsequent member serialised from flupke 1936–1957 series 1940 1946 wa popular an bob unsuccessfully range 1926 siècle their increased he blue drawing french designed including claire born jocko executed for acclaimed belgium were land allied 2009 faced project cinema best following remi 1944 aid prominent later zette form conducting produced onward pen zhang vingtième boyscout german congo style after 1907 — two such moor 1950 reversed plot they boy marriage far emphasis been year of adventure magazine prosper le action friend greatly attempted which draughtsmanship amid both him ongoing is belgian theatre 22 catholic snowy oversaw newspaper but nazi on personal gaming career contributing america shut it source 1983 tintin strong museum tibet wellresearched ʁəmi belge – his around reporter having official creating launched influence director studio traitor installment lowermiddleclass lotus liberation turmoil story european march television soir particularly new a soviet advice dog created placed administration no considered may contributed quick louvainlaneuve revolving wallez jacob influenced wide began accused accusation have and down artistic abstract one first celebrated work research widely leblanc jo brussels investigation although established developing hergé serialisation computer known ligne the brought himself establish mortimer against de 1934 artist to album child ɛʁʒe totor publication team edgar jacques amp 3 repeatedly scouting published 20th 1929 responsible collapse raymond with name volume resulting working martin through george rg became in greater initial	Belgian comics writer	belgian writer comic	Artists

Corneille Guillaume Beverloo	"<p><b>Corneille – Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo</b> (3 July 1922 – 5 September 2010), better known under his pseudonym <b>Corneille</b>, was a Dutch artist.</p><p>Corneille was born in Liège, Belgium, although his parents were Dutch and moved back to the Netherlands when he was 12. He studied art at the Academy of Art in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. He was one of the founders of the REFLEX movement in 1948 and in 1949 he was also one of the founders of the COBRA movement, which has had great influence on Scandinavian art. He was active within the group from the beginning, not only painting but also publishing poetry in the <i>Cobra magazine</i>. He was a cofounder of the <i>Experimentele Groep in Holland</i>. Corneille was inspired by the drawings of children, and believed in the importance of approaching children with art that connects with their experience. When he heard during a Cobra Museum visit in the nineties that there was an “Art Lending for Children” he talked with the founder <i>Roby Bellemans</i> and asked him to send more information to his home in Paris about this project. He decided to promote the initiative. He started with a support list and persuaded other artists such as Shinkichi Tajiri to sign. </p> <ul class=""gallery mw-gallery-traditional""><li class=""gallerybox"" style=""width: 155px""> <li class=""gallerybox"" style=""width: 155px""> </ul><p>The poetic Corneille was strongly influenced by Miró and Klee. After the group dissolved in 1951 he moved to Paris and began collecting African art. These artifacts became evident in his works, which began to take on a more imaginative style, like landscapes seen from a bird's eye view, exotic birds and stylised forms. His work is in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou.</p><p>Until his death Corneille lived and worked in Paris, and made visits to Israel where he worked with the Jaffa Atelier. </p><p>On 24 September 2003 an exhibition of his prints opened at the Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art, Israel. He died at Auvers-sur-Oise, France. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1375 Cached time: 20220507065428 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.565 seconds Real time usage: 0.777 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 2211/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 18803/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 2574/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 20/100 Expensive parser function count: 2/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 14127/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.293/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5639730/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 609.744 1 -total 48.89% 298.125 1 Template:Infobox_artist 47.76% 291.228 1 Template:Infobox_person 37.70% 229.894 1 Template:Infobox 20.36% 124.125 5 Template:Cite_web 20.19% 123.135 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 15.55% 94.843 1 Template:Short_description 14.23% 86.738 1 Template:Birth_date 10.89% 66.405 20 Template:Main_other 7.38% 45.013 1 Template:Pagetype -->"	july these worked reflex france holland more had initiative artistcorneille also like asked by believed made decided klee miró moved gan studied group opened visit other movement from lending where beverloo wa collection an “ persuaded lived this great auverssuroise he landscape drawing scandinavian beginning born cornelis for belgium were atelier groep connects project ramat when imaginative that 5 view evident form send dissolved netherlands support artifact take style after such exhibition information paris cofounder van started 24 experience seen dutch 1922 of magazine eye centre which strongly israel there him tajiri is importance but ” on list talked print museum 1949 amsterdam approaching – his about 2010 promote influence exotic september poetic 12 better death bird at roby corneille bellemans under jaffa a their experimentele art collecting israeli academy within guillaume poetry influenced not shinkichi began and one died work inspired although 1948 2003 liège known sign 1951 pompidouuntil founder the cobra artist stylised to child african publishing during home 3 only active ninety pseudonym parent ha back with heard george became in painting	Dutch artist of the COBRA movement better known as Corneille (1922-2010)	the better cobra artist corneille dutch movement a of known 19222010	Artists

William Shatner	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>William Alan Shatner</b> (born March 22, 1931) is a Canadian actor. In a career spanning seven decades, he is best known for his portrayal of Captain James T. Kirk of the USS <i>Enterprise</i> in the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise; from the second pilot in 1965 to his final appearance as Kirk in <i>Star Trek Generations</i> (1994). </p><p>Shatner began his screen acting career in Canadian films and television productions before moving into guest-starring roles in various US television shows. He appeared as Captain Kirk in all the episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>, 21 of the 22 episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Animated Series</i>, and the first seven <i>Star Trek</i> movies. He has written a series of books chronicling his experiences playing Captain Kirk, being a part of <i>Star Trek</i>, and life after <i>Star Trek</i>. He has also co-written several novels set in the <i>Star Trek</i> universe and a series of science fiction novels called <i>TekWar</i> that were adapted for television. Outside <i>Star Trek,</i> Shatner played the eponymous veteran police sergeant in <i>T. J. Hooker</i> (1982–1986) and hosted the reality-based television series <i>Rescue 911</i> (1989–1996), which won a People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Dramatic Series. His appearances as a guest star in two episodes of the television detective series <i>Columbo</i>, almost two decades apart, were among his many such contributions to television shows from the 1970s to the 2010s. </p><p>Shatner's television career after his last appearance as James Kirk embraced comedy, drama and reality shows. In seasons 4 and 5 of the NBC series <i>3rd Rock from the Sun</i>, he played the alien ""Big Giant Head"" to which the main characters reported. From 2004 until 2008, he starred as attorney Denny Crane in the final season of the legal show <i>The Practice</i> and in its spinoff <i>Boston Legal</i>, a role that earned him two Emmy Awards, one for his contribution to each series. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, he starred in both seasons of NBC's <i>Better Late Than Never</i>, a comical travel series in which a band of elderly celebrities toured east Asia and Europe.</p><p>Aside from acting, Shatner has had a career as a recording artist, beginning in 1968 with his album <i>The Transformed Man</i>. His cover versions of songs are dramatic recitations of their lyrics rather than musical performances: the most notable of them are his versions of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man"". The <i>sprechstimme</i> rendition of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" that he essayed when he hosted the 5th Saturn Awards in 1978 has often been parodied by comedians. His most successful album was his third, <i>Seeking Major Tom</i> (2011), which includes covers of ""Learning to Fly"", ""Space Oddity"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".</p><p>In 2021, Shatner flew into space aboard a Blue Origin sub-orbital capsule.

Charles Duke	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Charles Moss Duke Jr.</b> (born October 3, 1935) is an American former astronaut, United States Air Force (USAF) officer and test pilot. As lunar module pilot of Apollo 16 in 1972, he became the tenth and youngest person to walk on the Moon, at age 36 years and 201 days.</p><p>A 1957 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he joined the USAF. He completed advanced flight training on the F-86 Sabre at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, where he was a distinguished graduate. After completion of this training, Duke served three years as a fighter pilot with the 526th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. After graduating from the Aerospace Research Pilot School in September 1965, he stayed on as an instructor teaching control systems and flying in the F-101 Voodoo, F-104 Starfighter, and T-33 Shooting Star. </p><p>In April 1966, Duke was one of nineteen men selected for NASA's fifth group of astronauts. In 1969, he was a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10. He served as CAPCOM for Apollo 11, the first crewed landing on the Moon. His distinctive Southern drawl became familiar to audiences around the world, as the voice of a Mission Control made nervous by a long landing that almost expended all of the Lunar Module <i>Eagle</i> descent stage's propellant. Duke's first words to the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the Moon were flustered, ""Roger, Twank...Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot!"" </p><p>Duke was backup lunar module pilot on Apollo 13. Shortly before the mission, he caught rubella (German measles) from a friend's child and inadvertently exposed the prime crew to the disease. As Ken Mattingly had no natural immunity to the disease, he was replaced as command module pilot by Jack Swigert. Mattingly was reassigned as command module pilot of Duke's flight, Apollo 16. On this mission, Duke and John Young landed at the Descartes Highlands, and conducted three extravehicular activities (EVAs). He also served as backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 17. Duke retired from NASA on January 1, 1976. </p><p>Following his retirement from NASA, Duke entered the Air Force Reserve and served as a mobilization augmentee to the Commander, USAF Basic Military Training Center, and to the Commander, USAF Recruiting Service. He graduated from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1978. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, and retired in June 1986. He has logged 4,147 hours' flying time, of which 3,632 hours were in jet aircraft, and 265 hours were in space, including 21 hours and 38 minutes of EVA. </p><p>Duke resides in New Braunfels, Texas, and was named Texan of the Year in 2020. He is currently on the board of directors for the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation and previously served for two years as the chairman. He is a popular motivational speaker, with NASA films and personal stories of his Apollo mission on the moon.

WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey	"<p>The <b>WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey</b> was a large-scale astronomical redshift survey carried out on the 3.9 metre Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) at the Siding Spring Observatory, New South Wales between August 2006 and January 2011. The name stems from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the distribution of galaxies (“the baryon wiggles”).</p><p>The survey measured the redshift of 240,000 galaxies in the Southern sky. Redshift is the increase in the wavelength of light emitted by a galaxy caused by its speed of motion away from an observer on Earth, enabling the distance of the galaxy from Earth to be computed according to Hubble's Law. The redshifts were measured using the AAOmega spectrograph, which can simultaneously analyse 392 galaxy spectra using optical fibres controlled by a robot positioner, providing a superior mapping speed. Suitable targets were primarily selected by the orbiting GALEX satellite and to complete the survey required some 160 clear nights of telescope time. The data enabled a three dimensional computer model of the galaxies to be calculated. The large number of observations makes it possible to study variations in the distribution of the galaxies caused by such features as baryon acoustic oscillations. </p><p>The work was carried out by a core team of 14 Australia-based astronomers led by Chris Blake and including Sarah Brough, Warrick Couch, Karl Glazebrook, Greg Poole, Tamara Davis, Michael Drinkwater, Russell Jurek, Kevin Pimbblet, Matthew Colless, Rob Sharp, Scott Croom, Michael Pracy, David Woods, Barry Madore, Chris Martin and Ted Wyder. The work was done in conjunction with collaborators in Toronto, Canada and at the California Institute of Technology and Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States. </p><p>The underlying purpose of the survey was to improve understanding of the phenomenon of ""dark energy"", proposed as the mechanism for the observed increasing rate of expansion of the universe, contradicting the traditional theories of gravitational attraction. The survey results can be used in conjunction with measurements of Cosmic microwave background (CMB) to provide more accurate estimates of the composition of the universe. The results will also test current theories of gravity by mapping the growth of structure with redshift. Thirdly, detailed analysis of star-formation rates, environments, morphologies and luminosity functions will provide information on galaxy evolution. </p><p>The WiggleZ project was succeeded by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) based on the 2.5 metre telescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico and the Dark Energy Survey based on the 4 metre Blanco telescope in Chile. </p>"	wiggle underlying enabled observed jurek analyse selected number blake cmb astronomical oscillation variation distribution sarah more spectrum between time also used by dark russell laboratory improve computed contradicting apache controlled night largescale collaborator wavelength large background pimbblet microwave increasing ted suitable observer attraction from measurement enabling required spring can wa structure glazebrook an “ possible cosmic august understanding barry point bos warrick spectroscopic kevin be january superior according including davis wyder universe result morphology for were 160 wale project will carried chris current thirdly baryon test canada rob 25 target survey chile increase sharp observation mapping provide distance robot toronto light 2006 australiabased poole matthew starformation complete such information estimate observatory telescope accurate mexico conjunction of three environment led sky composition propulsion southern proposed which hubble primarily phenomenon earth pracy function is michael traditional detailed 14 couch 240000 ” analysis technology on aat gravity acoustic south redshift it growth 392 brough spectrograph feature drinkwater calculated theory some 2011 out providing motion croom law based energy speed 4 state at luminosity succeeded new done a angloaustralian positioner dimensional using aaomega caused measured simultaneously 39 colless madore expansion karl galex and away work make astronomer fibre satellite emitted computer wood gravitational siding blanco data united the rate stem california to jet team david clear greg core mechanism optical purpose scott evolution wigglez orbiting metre study name tamara with model martin galaxy institute in	scientific astronomy survey	astronomy scientific survey	Astronomical_objects

International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey	<p>The <b>International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey</b> (<b>INAS</b>) was an astronomical survey, organized and co-ordinated by prolific American astronomer Eleanor Helin during the 1980s. It is considered to be the international extension of the Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS).

Next-Generation Transit Survey	<p>The <b>Next-Generation Transit Survey</b> (<b>NGTS</b>) is a ground-based robotic search for exoplanets. The facility is located at Paranal Observatory in the Atacama desert in northern Chile, about 2 km from ESO's Very Large Telescope and 0.5 km from the VISTA Survey Telescope. Science operations began in early 2015. The astronomical survey is managed by a consortium of seven European universities and other academic institutions from Chile, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Prototypes of the array were tested in 2009 and 2010 on La Palma, and from 2012 to 2014 at Geneva Observatory.</p><p>The aim of NGTS is to discover super-Earths and exo-Neptunes transiting relatively bright and nearby stars with an apparent magnitude of up to 13. The survey uses transit photometry, which precisely measures the dimming of a star to detect the presence of a planet when it crosses in front of it. NGTS consists of an array of twelve commercial 0.2-metre telescopes (f/2.8), each equipped with a red-sensitive CCD camera operating in the visible and near-infrared at 600–900 nm. The array covers an instantaneous field of view of 96 square degrees (8 deg<sup>2</sup> per telescope) or around 0.23% of the entire sky. NGTS builds heavily on experience with SuperWASP, using more sensitive detectors, refined software, and larger optics, though having a much smaller field of view. Compared to the <i>Kepler</i> spacecraft with its original Kepler field of 115 square degrees, the sky area covered by NGTS will be sixteen times larger, because the survey intends to scan four different fields every year over a period of four years. As a result, the sky coverage will be comparable to that of Kepler's K2 phase.</p><p>NGTS is suited to ground-based photometric follow-up of exoplanet candidates from space-based telescopes such as TESS, <i>Gaia</i> and PLATO. In turn, larger instruments such as HARPS, ESPRESSO and VLT-SPHERE may follow-up on NGTS discoveries with a detailed characterization to measure the mass of a large number of targets using Doppler spectroscopy (wobble method) and make it possible to determine the exoplanet's density, and hence whether it is gaseous or rocky. This detailed characterization allows to fill the gap between Earth-sized planets and gas giants as other ground-based surveys can only detect Jupiter-sized exoplanets, and <i>Kepler</i><span>'</span>s Earth-sized planets are often too far away or orbit stars too dim to allow for the planet's mass determination. NGTS's wider field of view also enables it to detect a larger number of more-massive planets around brighter stars.</p>	vista academic 2014 detector aim number dim us 023 consists astronomical more exoplanet gaia located fill desert early between prototype square time turn by northern also gap determine switzerland seven are photometric allows doppler planet large kingdom 8 university facility visible other front from detect density can an possible exoplanets candidate 05 spacebased 2015 this presence method plato harp too spectroscopy be area over result degree for 2009 deg2 were equipped per operating much smaller vltsphere la very will when search that tested superwasp target survey view each chile spacecraft because 02metre rocky esos scan phasengts refined jupitersized earthsized enables allow mass heavily often managed such ccd up though observatory telescope te moremassive 600–900 experience transiting 115 photometry larger far nextgeneration sixteen compared year of magnitude nm palma entire sky bright km which precisely commercial covered whether star groundbased is detailed consortium germany cover on four suited it relatively institution sensitive coverage determination optic nearby twelve atacama around having about giant exoneptunes 2010 superearths period apparent different discover wobble robotic brighter nearinfrared original european at software a transit intends cross may science build characterization using ngts or hence 96 ngtss every discovery began camera and 2012 away 2 make k2 instrument comparable kepler gaseous wider array united the instantaneous espresso f28 to geneva gas followup observatorythe paranal only measure dimming redsensitive operation 13 with orbit in field	ground-based robotic search for exoplanets	for exoplanets groundbased search robotic	Astronomical_objects
Vera C. Rubin Observatory	"<p>The <b>Vera C. Rubin Observatory</b>, previously referred to as the <b>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</b> (<b>LSST</b>), is an astronomical observatory currently under construction in Chile. Its main task will be carrying out a synoptic astronomical survey, the <b>Legacy Survey of Space and Time</b> (<b>LSST</b>). The word <i>synoptic</i> is derived from the Greek words σύν (syn ""together"") and ὄψις (opsis ""view""), and describes observations that give a broad view of a subject at a particular time. The observatory is located on the El Peñón peak of Cerro Pachón, a 2,682-meter-high mountain in Coquimbo Region, in northern Chile, alongside the existing Gemini South and Southern Astrophysical Research Telescopes. The LSST Base Facility is located about 100 kilometres (62 mi) away by road, in the town of La Serena. The observatory is named for Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who pioneered discoveries about galaxy rotation rates. </p><p>The Rubin Observatory will house the <b>Simonyi Survey Telescope</b>, a wide-field reflecting telescope with an 8.4-meter primary mirror that will photograph the entire available sky every few nights. The telescope uses a novel three-mirror design, a variant of three-mirror anastigmat, which allows a compact telescope to deliver sharp images over a very wide 3.5-degree diameter field of view. Images will be recorded by a 3.2-gigapixel CCD imaging camera, the largest digital camera ever constructed.</p><p>The LSST was proposed in 2001, and construction of the mirror began (with private funds) in 2007. LSST then became the top-ranked large ground-based project in the 2010 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, and the project officially began construction 1 August 2014 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) authorized the FY2014 portion ($27.5 million) of its construction budget. Funding comes from the NSF, the United States Department of Energy, and private funding raised by the dedicated international non-profit organization, the LSST Corporation. Operations are under the management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA).</p><p>The ceremonial laying of the first stone was performed on 14 April 2015. Site construction began on April 14, 2015, with first light for the engineering camera expected in October 2022 and full survey operations not beginning before October 2023, due to COVID-related schedule delays. In January 2022, first light was delayed again to February 2023 and the start of operations to no earlier than December 2023.

It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Southwest Research Institute, Stanford University, NASA and the space industry. </p><p>As a non-governmental organization it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. It also assisted the Association of Space Explorers in helping the United Nations establish the International Asteroid Warning Network, as well as a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group to provide oversight on proposed asteroid deflection missions. </p><p>In 2012, the foundation announced it would design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space observatory, the Sentinel Space Telescope, to be launched in 2017–2018. Once stationed in a heliocentric orbit around the Sun similar to that of Venus, Sentinel's supercooled infrared detector would have helped identify dangerous asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth. In the absence of substantive planetary defense provided by governments worldwide, B612 attempted a fundraising campaign to cover the Sentinel Mission, estimated at $450 million for 10 years of operation. Fundraising was unsuccessful, and the program was cancelled in 2017, with the Foundation pursuing a constellation of smaller satellites instead.</p><p>The B612 Foundation is named for the asteroid home of the eponymous hero of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's 1943 book <i>The Little Prince</i>. </p>"	cancelled 1943 technological detector fundraising 2017 would venus also eponymous by book object foundation announced neo group university planetary other well estimated warning sun from detect wa engineer day defense asteroidfinding be substantive southwest financed helping for smaller pursuing advanced former stationed mill unsuccessful planning that private nearearth could path related million pose provide association impact absence insteadthe industry such two observatory telescope help year of headquartered supercooled led collision attempted proposed saintexupérys earth is advisory identify nongovernmental find network international cover valley on dangerous prince scientist it government line b612 organization assisted explorer around space similar infrared risk launched nasa 450 campaign state named at mainly deflection 2017–2018 nation a their worldwide neos conducted mean science build once astronaut nonprofit stanford provided 10 have and 2012 one research antoine mission satellite avoid sentinel united the establish strike against hero de california to constellation home divert dedicated operation program ha study with little orbit heliocentric helped asteroid institute in design privately oversight	nonprofit organization	organization nonprofit	Astronomical_objects

All Sky Automated Survey	<p>The <b>All Sky Automated Survey</b> (<b>ASAS</b>) is a Polish project implemented on 7 April 1997 to do photometric monitoring of approximately 20 million stars brighter than 14 magnitude all over the sky. The automatic telescopes discovered two new comets in 2004 and 2006. The ASAS-South, located in Chile and ASAS-North, located in Hawai'i, are managed by Grzegorz Pojmański of the Warsaw University Observatory via the internet.</p><p>The idea was initiated by the Polish astronomy Professor Bohdan Paczyński of Princeton University. The prototype instrument and data pipeline were designed and built by Grzegorz Pojmański. The work on the ASAS program began in 1996 with a mere $1 million budget. The automatic telescope, located in Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, was designed to register the brightness of circa one million stars in the Southern Hemisphere. However, it proved very efficient and helped to find many new variable stars. The project was then expanded, and now operates four telescopes located in Las Campanas Observatory. The Chilean observatory is operated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.</p><p>So far, ASAS has discovered 50,000 variables located south of declination +28°, which means that it has covered 3/4 of all the sky. Pojmański comes to Chile only once every year. The telescope works automatically. Routine work such as exchanging of the data is done by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) observers. Such an intervention is needed once a week. On each starry night when an OGLE observator opens or closes the dome, the ASAS booth is opened or closed automatically.</p><p>Grzegorz Pojmański is supported in the project by the State Committee for Scientific Research, Poland.

All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae	<p>The <b>All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae</b> (<b>ASAS-SN</b>) is an automated program to search for new supernovae and other astronomical transients, headed by astronomers from the Ohio State University, including Christopher Kochanek and Krzysztof Stanek. It has 20 robotic telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. It can survey the entire sky approximately once every day.</p><p>Initially, there were four ASAS-SN telescopes at Haleakala and another four at Cerro Tololo, a Las Cumbres Observatory site. Twelve more telescopes were deployed in 2017 in Chile, South Africa and Texas, with funds from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Ohio State University, the Mount Cuba Astronomical Foundation, China, Chile, Denmark, and Germany. All the telescopes (Nikon telephoto f400/2.8 lenses) have a diameter of 14 cm and ProLine PL230 CCD cameras. The pixels in the cameras span 7.8 arc seconds, so follow up observations on other telescopes are usually required to get a more accurate location.</p><p>The main goal of the project is to look for bright supernovae, and its discoveries have included the most powerful supernova event ever discovered, ASASSN-15lh. However, other transient objects are frequently discovered, including nearby tidal disruption events (TDEs) (e.g., ASASSN-19bt), Galactic novae (e.g., ASASSN-16kt, ASASSN-16ma, and ASASSN-18fv), cataclysmic variables, and stellar flares, including several of the largest flares ever seen. In July 2017 ASAS-SN discovered its first comet, ASASSN1, and in July 2019 it provided crucial data for the near-Earth asteroid 2019 OK.

The Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center built the IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo sensors respectively. The Orbital Sciences Corporation manufactured the satellite bus and was the location for spacecraft environmental testing. The nominal mission baseline duration was two years after commissioning, and the prime ended in early 2011. The spacecraft and sensors are still healthy and the mission is continuing in its extended mission.</p><p>IBEX is in a Sun-oriented spin-stabilized orbit around the Earth. In June 2011, IBEX was shifted to a new, more efficient, much more stable orbit. It does not come as close to the Moon in the new orbit, and expends less fuel to maintain its position.</p><p>The Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) is an Earth-orbiting mission designed to make observations beyond the solar system's termination shock using energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). The spacecraft is equipped with two large aperture imagers which detect ENAs with energies from 10 eV to 2 keV (IBEX-Lo) and 300 eV to 6 keV (IBEX-Hi). On 19 October 2008 at 17:48 UTC IBEX was launched on a Pegasus XL rocket from an L-1011 aircraft flying about 200 km north of Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. The Pegasus will put it into a 100 km low Earth orbit. Its solid rocket motor will then put it into a highly elliptical 11 degree inclination orbit an apogee of about 320,000 km to put it beyond interference from the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft propulsion system will raise the perigee to 7000 km and leave IBEX in an eight day orbit, spinning at 4 rpm with a sun-facing axis. The mission is planned for a 24 month operations period with the possibility of extension. </p> "	stable ended 320000 2008 lockheed flying us interaction aircraft more june between early kev by laboratory launch neutral 300 are orbital moon interstellar 19 elliptical continuing large university 7000 1748 xl from perigee detect part wa principal motor an low doe day los rocket ibexhi designed southwest solar commissioning built national degree location for equipped advanced much highly efficient will spinning pacific sunoriented month that j atoll spacecraft prime put magnetic shifted observation small respectively pegasusxl duration still spinstabilized after positionthe two imagers close kwajalein raise 24 earthorbiting smex10 energetic 2008the nominal utc year of le baseline environmental 100 led propulsion which km earth then is l1011 sensor now 200 technology on apogee rpm testing 6 south it region investigator bus enas around explorer sunfacing about space vehicle launched missionibex interference 2011 period nasa swri maintain extension energy 4 shock at 11 91 new extended a alamo princeton science beyond pegasus using healthy boundary or ibexlo into 10 not termination planned dr image and center inclination research make 2 fuel atom satellite mission mccomas formerly system the october come ibex to corporation david aperture possibility eight operation program ev manufactured expends with leave solid orbit martin north axis institute in field	NASA satellite	satellite nasa	Astronomical_objects
Ohio Sky Survey	"<p>The <b>Ohio Sky Survey</b> was an astronomical survey of extragalactic radio sources. Data were taken between 1965 and 1971 using the Big Ear radio telescope at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory (OSURO), also known as the ""Big Ear Radio Observatory (BERO)"". </p><p>The survey covered 94% of the sky area between the limiting declinations of 63°N and 36°S with a resolution at 1415 MHz of 40 arc minutes in declination. The survey was carried out primarily at a frequency of 1415 MHz but observations were also made at 2650 MHz and 612 MHz. Roughly 19,620 sources were identified over the course of the survey of which 60% were previously uncatalogued. </p><p>The survey was unique in that it covered a larger portion of the sky, to a greater depth, and at a higher frequency, than any previous survey. In addition, all previously catalogued sources were tabulated and maps of the areas surveyed were included with the positions of all catalogued sources. </p><p>Sources discovered in the course of the survey were assigned names according to a coordinate numbering system consisting of a two-letter prefix followed by three digits. The first letter, O, stood for Ohio, and the second letter, B–Z inclusive (omitting O) indicated the source right ascension in hours (0–23 inclusive). The first digit indicated the declination zone in increments of 10°, while the last two digits give the source number within the specified region of right ascension and declination.</p><p>Data reduction for the survey was done using a computer program developed by John D.

List of deep fields	<p>In astronomy, a <b>deep field</b> is an image of a portion of the sky taken with a very long exposure time, in order to detect and study faint objects. The depth of the field refers to the apparent magnitude or the flux of the faintest objects that can be detected in the image. Deep field observations usually cover a small angular area on the sky, because of the large amounts of telescope time required to reach faint flux limits. Deep fields are used primarily to study galaxy evolution and the cosmic evolution of active galactic nuclei, and to detect faint objects at high redshift. Numerous ground-based and space-based observatories have taken deep-field observations at wavelengths spanning radio to X-rays. </p><p>The first deep-field image to receive a great deal of public attention was the Hubble Deep Field, observed in 1995 with the WFPC2 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Messier object	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Messier objects</b> are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his <i>Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles</i> (<i>Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters</i>). Because Messier was only interested in finding comets, he created a list of those non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them. The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is known as <i>the Messier catalogue</i>. This catalogue of objects is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier numbers. The catalogue includes most of the astronomical deep-sky objects that can easily be observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere; many Messier objects are popular targets for amateur astronomers.</p><p>A preliminary version first appeared in 1774 in the <i>Memoirs</i> of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1771. The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects which were not yet numbered. Eighteen of the objects were discovered by Messier, the rest being previously observed by other astronomers. By 1780 the catalogue had increased to 70 objects. The final version of the catalogue containing 103 objects was published in 1781 in the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i> for the year 1784. However, due to what was thought for a long time to be the incorrect addition of Messier 102, the total number remained 102. Other astronomers, using side notes in Messier's texts, eventually filled out the list up to 110 objects.</p><p>The catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies. For example, Messier 1 is a supernova remnant, known as the Crab Nebula, and the great spiral Andromeda Galaxy is M31. Further inclusions followed, the first addition came from Nicolas Camille Flammarion in 1921, who added Messier 104 after finding Messier's side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue. M105 to M107 were added by Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947, M108 and M109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960, and M110 by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967.</p>"	pierre 102 observed referenced nébuleuses 1771 most number consists astronomical 70 had compilation time by northern object connaissance messier are catalogue nebula 1921 noncomet other version m31 hunt who from helen m109 added 104 can wa popular 103 memoir includes range due this great increased he french be for edition were eighteen glyn many diverse those gingerich thought filled that target remained astronomersa numbered yet because m110 objectsthe famous flammarion still 1784 eventually after amateur them 1774 up hogg deepsky assistant however 110 1960 collaboration year of méchain contained finding frustrated final appeared which earth star cluster is set addition total et supernova jones preliminary list came side 1967 temp charles catalogued 45 containing 1781 his 1947 out inclusion rest 1780 text m105 owen exemplar further messiers sawyer a their created m108 long science being using détoiles academy discovered remnant hemisphere 1 not example and m107 one first crab astronomer note spiral previously known easily comet the incorrect interested de to nicolas amas andromeda only published what with camille kenneth followed galaxy in	Astronomical catalogue of deep sky objects	object of catalogue deep astronomical sky	Astronomical_objects

Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebulae	<p>The <b>Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebulae</b> was created in 1966 by George O. Abell and was composed of 86 entries thought to be planetary nebulae that were collected from discoveries, about half by Albert George Wilson and the rest by Abell, Robert George Harrington, and Rudolph Minkowski. All were discovered before August 1955 as part of the National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey on photographic plates created with the 48-inch (1.2 m) Samuel Oschin telescope at Mount Palomar. Four are better known from previous catalogs: Abell 50 is NGC 6742, Abell 75 is NGC 7076, Abell 37 is IC 972, and Abell 81 is IC 1454. Another four were later rejected as not being planetaries: Abell 11 (reflection nebula), Abell 32 (red plate flaw), Abell 76 (ring galaxy PGC 85185), and Abell 85 (supernova remnant CTB 1 and noted as possibly such in Abell's 1966 paper). Another three were also not included in the Strasbourg-ESO Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae (SEC): Abell 9, Abell 17 (red plate flaw), and Abell 64.

Caldwell catalogue	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Caldwell catalogue</b> is an astronomical catalogue of 109 star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies for observation by amateur astronomers. The list was compiled by Patrick Moore as a complement to the Messier catalogue.</p><p>While the Messier catalogue is used by amateur astronomers as a list of deep-sky objects for observation, Moore noted that Messier's list was not compiled for that purpose and excluded many of the sky's brightest deep-sky objects, such as the Hyades, the Double Cluster (NGC 869 and NGC 884), and the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253). The Messier catalogue was actually compiled as a list of known objects that might be confused with comets. Moore also observed that since Messier compiled his list from observations in Paris, it did not include bright deep-sky objects visible in the Southern Hemisphere, such as Omega Centauri, Centaurus A, the Jewel Box, and 47 Tucanae. Moore compiled a list of 109 objects to match the commonly accepted number of Messier objects (he excluded M110), and the list was published in <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> in December 1995.</p><p>Moore used his other surname – Caldwell – to name the list, since the initial of ""Moore"" is already used for the Messier catalogue. Entries in the catalogue are designated with a ""C"" and the catalogue number (1 to 109). </p><p>Unlike objects in the Messier catalogue, which are listed roughly in the order of discovery by Messier and his colleagues, the Caldwell catalogue is ordered by declination, with C1 being the most northerly and C109 being the most southerly, although two objects (NGC 4244 and the Hyades) are listed out of sequence.

Comet	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>comet</b> is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process that is called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions. </p><p>Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition. </p><p>Comets are distinguished from asteroids by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets. In the early 21st century, the discovery of some minor bodies with long-period comet orbits, but characteristics of inner solar system asteroids, were called Manx comets. They are still classified as comets, such as C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). 27 Manx comets were found from 2013 to 2017.</p><p>As of November 2021 there are 4584 known comets. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of the total potential comet population, as the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer Solar System (in the Oort cloud) is estimated to be one trillion. Roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye, though many of those are faint and unspectacular. Particularly bright examples are called ""great comets"". Comets have been visited by unmanned probes such as the European Space Agency's <i>Rosetta</i>, which became the first to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet, and NASA's <i>Deep Impact</i>, which blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1316 Cached time: 20220514100516 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.480 seconds Real time usage: 0.575 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1221/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 28278/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1544/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 21/100 Expensive parser function count: 13/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 22662/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.293/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5453964/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 534.246 1 -total 20.16% 107.709 3 Template:Cite_book 17.42% 93.053 1 Template:Short_description 17.06% 91.145 1 Template:Pp-pc1 10.55% 56.346 1 Template:Pagetype 9.95% 53.140 5 Template:Main_other 7.07% 37.769 1 Template:Good_article 6.58% 35.150 1 Template:Top_icon 6.31% 33.726 1 Template:Multiple_image 5.99% 31.987 1 Template:About -->"	s3 radiation tail these sometimes observed astronomical passing dust century classified kuiper longperiod between time also early naked by scattered visited tempel extinct spherical interior are moon orbital interstellar elliptical characteristic planet tide crater visible distinction unit estimated stretch sun lie from central neptune part without meter collection an panstarrs upon range due belt this since linear cometlike oort presence great nearest be blasted solar cloud plasma begin several formed were per inner acting wind many highly c2014 those land thought galactic when release diameter composed probe that 2021 potential kilometer aid population flung ten spacecraft while million became manx hyperbolic effect nearly rocky impact small religion typically light still roughly culture gravitationally 15 faint such consisting close up 21st though telescope however seen they shortperiod been distinguished year of section extending eye lost 4584 recorded sky 60 unbound before bright which phenomenon earth there star particle trillion is set fraction total but immediately rather produce on outstreaming halfway it eccentric centaur minor outside perturbation origin outgassing having inside space november period some out passed volatile motion different blown nasa originate blurred usually robotic european apparition particularly extended a their nucleus reservoir deep may loose unspectacular beyond once outer being all found caused icy surrounding or ice pressure represents tiny 1 example arc ancient wide have discovery 2013 and mainbelt one first if subtend rosetta towards appearance process potentially gravitational known 30° 2017as system comet disc the unmanned come resemble than to ranging body called gas jupiter pas only sufficiently hundred active coma warms few ha 27 study with across orbit termed associated through asteroid atmosphere in agency	icy small astronomical object	icy astronomical small object	Astronomical_objects
Megamaser	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>megamaser</b> is a type of astrophysical maser, which is a naturally occurring source of stimulated spectral line emission. Megamasers are distinguished from other astrophysical masers by their large isotropic luminosity. Megamasers have typical luminosities of 10<sup>3</sup> solar luminosities (<var>L</var><sub>☉</sub>), which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the Milky Way, hence the prefix mega. Likewise, the term <b>kilomaser</b> is used to describe masers outside the Milky Way that have luminosities of order <var>L</var><sub>☉</sub>, or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, <b>gigamaser</b> is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, and <b>extragalactic maser</b> encompasses all masers found outside the Milky Way. Most known extragalactic masers are megamasers, and the majority of megamasers are hydroxyl (OH) megamasers, meaning the spectral line being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule. There are known megamasers for three other molecules: water (H<sub>2</sub>O), formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO), and methine (CH). </p><p>Water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, and there are a small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust.

Cosmic microwave background	"<p>The <b>cosmic microwave background</b> (<b>CMB, CMBR</b>), in Big Bang cosmology, is electromagnetic radiation which is a remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as ""relic radiation"". The CMB is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space. It is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination. With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise, or glow, almost isotropic, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1965 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. </p><p>CMB is landmark evidence of the Big Bang origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with an opaque fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded the plasma grew cooler and the radiation filling it expanded to longer wavelengths. When the temperature had dropped enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the plasma, these newly conceived atoms could not scatter the thermal radiation by Thomson scattering, and so the universe became transparent. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the <i>recombination epoch</i>, and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space is referred to as photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This is the source of the alternative term <i>relic radiation</i>. The <i>surface of last scattering</i> refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling. </p>"	radiation these electron american radio unlike cmb fog had we spectrum electromagnetic early between time also by prize surface dark object term propagating neutral are last oldest planet wavelength background microwave other from young earned right enough wa cosmic an referred this since point recombination 1978 nobel accidental scatter over according plasma alternative universe formed much those filled when cause that inversely could form increase because dating shortly almost distance denser freely existed proton stage transparent robert cosmology thermal though thomson started telescope however decoupling energetic planck 1940s been of newly le strongest relation big glow before which hotter scattering travel star is traditional set physic so now initiated on evidence isotropic hydrogen it source region opaque originally dropped sensitive landmark origin cooler culmination ever space event period proportional cosmologist energy photon at u growing temperature filling a expanded their bang grew all remnant arno noise or expansion not relic discovery have epoch and first work astronomer cmbr atom emitted known data combined refer the receiving important 1965 afterwards to discoverer penzias show optical longer sufficiently any wilson conceived completely with associated faint galaxy became in formation through refers	type of thermal radiation; cosmic background radiation that is fundamental to observational cosmology because it is the oldest light in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination	radiation is that type epoch because it dating oldest light the background to fundamental thermal cosmology cosmic observational recombination of in universe	Astronomical_objects
Cosmic noise	<p><b>Cosmic noise</b>, also known as <b>galactic radio noise</b>, is not actually sound, but a physical phenomenon derived from outside of the Earth's atmosphere. It can be detected through a radio receiver, which is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information given by them to an audible form. Its characteristics are comparable to those of thermal noise. Cosmic noise occurs at frequencies above about 15 MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or other regions of the sky, such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Celestial objects like quasars, which are super dense objects far from Earth, emit electromagnetic waves in their full spectrum, including radio waves. The fall of a meteorite can also be heard through a radio receiver; the falling object burns from friction with the Earth's atmosphere, ionizing surrounding gases and producing radio waves. Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) from outer space is also a form of cosmic noise. CMBR is thought to be a relic of the Big Bang, and pervades the space almost homogeneously over the entire celestial sphere. The bandwidth of the CMBR is wide, though the peak is in the microwave range. </p>	radiation above sphere radio spectrum electromagnetic producing also like by object full are characteristic meteorite background directional microwave actually other friction sun from quasar can receives cosmic an range be including over derived highly those thought galactic when homogeneously that frequency form given dense almost 15 such them thermal information though far of super entire milky sky pervades big which phenomenon occurs earth is but sound convert electronic it device region way outside about space fall wave audible at ionizing a their receiver bang peak outer emit celestial burn bandwidth surrounding noise or not relic wide and center cmbr comparable toward known mhz falling the pointed to gas antenna detected heard with physical through galaxy atmosphere in	random radio noise that originates outside the Earth's atmosphere	the earth noise that random radio outside atmosphere originates	Astronomical_objects

These energetic radio lobes are powered by jets from its active galactic nucleus. They have luminousities at radio wavelengths up to 10<sup>39</sup> W between 10 MHz and 100 GHz. The radio emission is due to the synchrotron process. The observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium, modified by the effects of relativistic beaming. The host galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical galaxies. <i>Radio-loud</i> active galaxies can be detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for observational cosmology.

The name Sagittarius A* follows from historical reasons. In 1954, John D. Kraus, Hsien-Ching Ko, and Sean Matt listed the radio sources they identified with the Ohio State University radio telescope at 250 MHz. The sources were arranged by constellation and the letter assigned to them was arbitrary, with A denoting the brightest radio source within the constellation. The asterisk was later assigned in 1982 by Robert L. Brown, who understood that the strongest radio emission from the center of the galaxy appeared to be due to a compact nonthermal radio object. The discovery was considered ""exciting"", and in atomic physics the nomenclature for excited state atoms is denoted with an asterisk (e.g. the excited state of Helium would be He*). </p><p>The observations of several stars orbiting Sagittarius A*, particularly star S2, have been used to determine the mass and upper limits on the radius of the object. Based on mass and increasingly precise radius limits, astronomers have concluded that Sagittarius A* must be the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. The current value of its mass is 4.154 (± 0.014) million solar masses.</p><p>Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery that Sagittarius A* is a supermassive compact object, for which a black hole was the only plausible explanation at the time.</p><p>On May 12, 2022, astronomers, using the Event Horizon Telescope, released a photograph of Sagittarius A* produced using data from radio observations in April 2017, confirming the object to be a black hole.

Black hole bomb	<p>A <b>black hole bomb</b> is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole can be amplified through superradiant scattering. If the amplified field is reflected back towards the black hole, the amplification can be repeated, leading to a run-away growth of the field, i.e. an explosion. One way this reflection could be realized in nature is if the bosonic field has mass. The mass of the field can then cause the amplified modes to be trapped around the black hole, leading to an endless cycle of self-amplification.

Brightest cluster galaxy	<p>A <b>brightest cluster galaxy</b> (<b>BCG</b>) is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies. BCGs include the most massive galaxies in the universe. They are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster, hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well. They are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster X-ray emission.</p><p>Formation scenarios for BCGs include: </p> <ul><li>Cooling flow—Star formation from the central cooling flow in high density cooling centers of X-ray cluster halos.</li></ul><p>The study of accretion populations in BCGs has cast doubt over this theory and astronomers have seen no evidence of cooling flows in radiative cooling clusters. The two remaining theories exhibit healthier prospects. </p> <ul><li>Galactic cannibalism—Galaxies sink to the center of the cluster due to dynamical friction and tidal stripping.</li> <li>Galactic merger—Rapid galactic mergers between several galaxies take place during cluster collapse.</li></ul><p>It is possible to differentiate the cannibalism model from the merging model by considering the formation period of the BCGs. In the cannibalism model, there are numerous small galaxies present in the evolved cluster, whereas in the merging model, a hierarchical cosmological model is expected due to the collapse of clusters. It has been shown that the orbit decay of cluster galaxies is not effective enough to account for the growth of BCGs. The merging model is now generally accepted as the most likely one, but recent observations are at odds with some of its predictions. For example, it has been found that the stellar mass of BCGs was assembled much earlier than the merging model predicts.</p> <p>BCGs are divided into various classes of galaxies: giant ellipticals (gE), D galaxies and cD galaxies. cD and D galaxies both exhibit an extended diffuse envelope surrounding an elliptical-like nucleus akin to regular elliptical galaxies. The light profiles of BCGs are often described by a Sersic surface brightness law, a double Sersic profile or a de Vaucouleurs law. The different parametrizations of the light profile of BCG's, as well as the faintness of the diffuse envelope lead to discrepancies in the reported values of the sizes of these objects. </p>	these most expected between also cast dynamical by surface object are elliptical well friction lie from central coincident prediction stripping density enough wa doubt likely possible an accretion include discrepancy due this cannibalism account collapseit earlier akin effective over universe several considering for merging much recent stellar shown hierarchical reported galactic bcg that potential population scenario bcgs place differentiate halosthe described observation small light high massive take mass ellipticallike profile often two parametrizations close they seen cosmological been generally of which there cluster both kinematical is radiative but accepted numerous now size cd evidence odds merger—rapid it growth lead ellipticals envelope evolved giant value theory period some different law class at extended a their no divided nucleus peak host geometric found surrounding into hence or tidal not present example diffuse sink ge have healthier and center various flow—star one astronomer d faintness double defined xray prospect merger bottom the whereas decay de than to flow remaining during brightness brightest sersic emissionformation cannibalism—galaxies predicts ha collapse assembled study with model orbit regular exhibit galaxy in formation cooling vaucouleurs	brightest galaxy within a galaxy cluster	galaxy within cluster a brightest	Astronomical_objects
Spin-flip	<p>A <b>black hole spin-flip</b> occurs when the spin axis of a rotating black hole undergoes a sudden change in orientation due to absorption of a second (smaller) black hole. Spin-flips are believed to be a consequence of galaxy mergers, when two supermassive black holes form a bound pair at the center of the merged galaxy and coalesce after emitting gravitational waves. Spin-flips are significant astrophysically since a number of physical processes are associated with black hole spins; for instance, jets in active galaxies are believed to be launched parallel to the spin axes of supermassive black holes.

Glass	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Glass</b> is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics. Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are ""silicate glasses"" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. The term <i>glass</i>, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology. Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material. </p><p>Although brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria. The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience. Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass. The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials. Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass). </p>"	glassmaking faience technological most survive type 70 quartz bc early plastic commonly also used by decorative shape object term made bead are lens oldest glassfibre chemical amorphous suitable archaeological material from traditionally noncrystalline vas can popular due this account prism be buried pane for reflective formed silica were application wool many very silicate will usage when dioxide that production vessel widespread form sodalime coloured insulating simply salt volcanic culture transparent often constituent such thermal printed earliest sand they refractive desirable been compound of egypt adding practical suggests ease is familiar network so technology on evidence molten syria it modern 90 optic metal formability optoelectronics around containing extruded quenching some period property jar naturally date air based fragment rapid exist tableware at least matted eyeglass fibreglass a bottle manufacturing paperweight use created silicafree primary long trap into or 3600 mesopotamia silicon not transmission example accidentally marble have silicatebased glass and if drinking make fibre historically although known refer the disturbed to called reinforced brittle during optical only occurring any window metalworking ha manufactured enamelled back communication name solid perhaps painted bowl in cooling	amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state	the state heated liquid amorphous towards solid a when exhibit transition that glass	Building
Building developer	<p><b>Real estate development</b>, or <b>property development</b>, is a business process, encompassing activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others. Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities, converting ideas from paper to real property. Real estate development is different from construction or housebuilding, although many developers also manage the construction process or engage in housebuilding. </p><p>Developers buy land, finance real estate deals, build or have builders build projects, develop projects in joint venture, create, imagine, control, and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end. Developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate and receive the greatest rewards. Typically, developers purchase a tract of land, determine the marketing of the property, develop the building program and design, obtain the necessary public approval and financing, build the structures, and rent out, manage, and ultimately sell it.</p><p>Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process. For example, some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price. Alternatively, a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately. </p><p>Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process, including architects, city planners, engineers, surveyors, inspectors, contractors, lawyers, leasing agents, etc. In the Town and Country Planning context in the United Kingdom, 'development' is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s55. </p>	imagine these control plan 1990 tract construction permit start purchase real developer also leasing approval housebuilding determine sale deal ultimately are lawyer joint kingdom who from part structure greatest can venture selling range development this engineer beginning manage including architect town for land context building many project will etc finance others company activity release premium encompassing planning that inspector raw financing each engage reward place typically take along approved they city create contractor business existing of coordinate itsometimes before is estate rent s55 immediately so orchestrate on develop sell source end failing risk do obtain some property out different usually agent marketing converting at planner act a undertake may build idea all surveyor paper buy or public creation not parcel example have and receive work although process defined country united the step to counterpart necessary alternatively renovation only developed program people with builder get price in design	multifaceted business encompassing activities related to buildings and land	and land building to related business multifaceted activity encompassing	Building

Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where ""individuals use raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)"". DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).</p><p>The term ""do-it-yourself"" has been associated with consumers since at least 1912 primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities. The phrase ""do it yourself"" had come into common usage (in standard English) by the 1950s, in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking home improvement and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity. </p><p>Subsequently, the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets. DIY has been described as a ""self-made-culture""; one of designing, creating, customizing and repairing items or things without any special training. DIY has grown to become a social concept with people sharing ideas, designs, techniques, methods and finished projects with one another either online or in person. </p><p>DIY can be seen as a cultural reaction in modern technological society to increasing academic specialization and economic specialization which brings people into contact with only a tiny focus area within the larger context, positioning DIY as a venue for holistic engagement. <b>DIY ethic</b> is the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert.

To better understand the term <i>building</i> compare the list of nonbuilding structures. </p><p>Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the <i>outside</i> (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful). </p><p>Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression.

Post and lintel	<p>In architecture, <b>post and lintel</b> (also called <b>prop and lintel</b> or a <b>trabeated system</b>) is a building system where strong horizontal elements are held up by strong vertical elements with large spaces between them. This is usually used to hold up a roof, creating a largely open space beneath, for whatever use the building is designed. The horizontal elements are called by a variety of names including lintel, header, architrave or beam, and the supporting vertical elements may be called columns, pillars, or posts. The use of wider elements at the top of the post, called capitals, to help spread the load, is common to many traditions. </p><p>The trabeated system is a fundamental principle of Neolithic architecture, ancient Indian architecture, ancient Greek architecture and ancient Egyptian architecture. Other trabeated styles are the Persian, Lycian, Japanese, traditional Chinese, and ancient Chinese architecture, especially in northern China, and nearly all the Indian styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by Mayan architecture, and in South America by Inca architecture. In all or most of these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings. Timber framing, also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day. </p><p>The biggest disadvantage to a post and lintel construction is the limited weight that can be held up, and the small distances required between the posts. Ancient Roman architecture's development of the arch allowed for much larger structures to be constructed. The arcuated system spreads larger loads more effectively, and replaced the post and lintel trabeated system in most larger buildings and structures, until the introduction of steel girder beams in the industrial era. As with the Roman temple portico front and its descendants in later classical architecture, trabeated features were often retained in parts of buildings as an aesthetic choice. The classical orders of Greek origin were in particular retained in buildings designed to impress, even though they usually had little or no structural role.</p> 	remains these order supporting most house construction more had beam between also portico used by roof lycian northern tradition arcuated are inca large other front largely version role where central disadvantage open required vertical structure architrave can part timber an india development choice this indian day arch biggest industrial architecture including designed be roman temple hold for smaller descendant were much building many certainly beneath capital that held stone later allowed neolithic nearly distance small classical trabeated style introduction often such them up weight earliest until though they larger help even represented effectively persian header of pillar constructed prop greece which framing post is traditional era mayan replaced particular america south it modern strong origin chinese feature space creating steel girder china fundamental translated impress usually load at egyptian grander column a no use principle may element all using structural retained into or limited ancient variety top and spread aesthetic greek whatever wood horizontal wider system japanese the to called common especially developed lintel truss little with name north in	building system where horizontal elements (beams or lintels) are held up by vertical elements (posts)	beam lintel element building up by post or where are horizontal vertical system held	Building
Straw-bale construction	"<p><b>Straw-bale construction</b> is a building method that uses bales of straw (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, building insulation, or both. This construction method is commonly used in natural building or ""brown"" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.</p><p>Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value. Disadvantages include susceptibility to rot, difficulty of obtaining insurance coverage, and high space requirements for the straw itself. Research has been done using moisture probes placed within the straw wall in which 7 of 8 locations had moisture contents of less than 20%. This is a moisture level that does not aid in the breakdown of the straw. However, proper construction of the straw-bale wall is important in keeping moisture levels down, just as in the construction of any type of building. </p>"	conventional construction us type had commonly used itself bale breakdown 8 material from disadvantage renewable wall include this doe oat method wheat over nature for location building project shown natural straw insulation probe that rice aid obtaining high difficulty however standpoint been proper of just le easy 7 which both is insurance coolingadvantages cost brown coverage space value susceptibility naturally energy needed level done a placed availability element using 20 structural within or requirement not and down research heating sustainable fireretardant content system strawbale the important than to rye rot any ha moisture keeping in	building method that uses bales of straw (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, building insulation, or both	element structural building or both straw us insulation that rice and commonly bale rye oat method a of wheat	Building
Modular building	<p>A <b>modular building</b> is a prefabricated building that consists of repeated sections called modules. Modularity involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a crane. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing for a variety of configurations and styles. After placement, the modules are joined together using inter-module connections, also known as inter-connections. The inter-connections tie the individual modules together to form the overall building structure.</p>	for site using crane building sometimes module or then is repeated allowing prefabricated placement sidebyside consists variety that on and away also joined form are modular intended known connection the intermodule individual delivering together to called style interconnection tie after from constructing completed them overall can structure stacked involves a of section placed installation be modularity endtoend configuration	prefabricated building or house that consists of repeated sections	building or repeated prefabricated of section consists house that	Building
Diagrid	"<p>A <b>diagrid</b> (a portmanteau of <b>diagonal grid</b>) is a framework of diagonally intersecting metal, concrete, or wooden beams that is used in the construction of buildings and roofs. It requires less structural steel than a conventional steel frame. Hearst Tower in New York City, designed by Norman Foster, uses 21 percent less steel than a standard design. The diagrid obviates the need for columns and can be used to make large column-free expanses of roofing. Another iconic building designed by Foster, 30 St Mary Axe, in London, UK, known as ""The Gherkin"", also uses the diagrid system. </p><p> British architect Ian Ritchie wrote in 2012: </p><blockquote class=""templatequote""><p>The origin of 'diagonal' structures is surely the Russian genius Vladimir Shukhov.

Green building	<p><b>Green building</b> (also known as <b>green construction</b> or <b>sustainable building</b>) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. In doing so, the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., planet, people and profit across the entire supply chain need to be considered.</p><p>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia. </p><p>Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels. </p><p>Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by: </p> <ul><li>Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</li> <li>Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)</li> <li>Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation</li></ul><p>A similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction. </p><p>A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance.

Thirteenth floor	"<p>The <b>thirteenth floor</b> is a designation of a level of a multi-level building that is often omitted in countries where the number 13 is considered unlucky. Omitting the 13th floor may take a variety of forms; the most common include denoting what would otherwise be considered the thirteenth floor as level 14, giving the thirteenth floor an alternate designation such as ""12A"" or ""M"" (the thirteenth letter of the Latin alphabet), or closing the 13th floor to public occupancy or access (e.g., by designating it as a mechanical floor). </p><p>Reasons for omitting a thirteenth floor include triskaidekaphobia on the part of the building's owner or builder, or a desire by the building owner or landlord to prevent problems that may arise with superstitious tenants, occupants, or customers. In 2002, based on an internal review of records, Dilip Rangnekar of Otis Elevators estimated that 85% of the buildings with Otis brand elevators did not have a floor named the 13th floor. Early tall-building designers, fearing a fire on the 13th floor, or fearing tenants' superstitions about the rumor, decided to omit having a 13th floor listed on their elevator numbering.

Tilt up	"<p><b>Tilt-up,</b> <b>tilt-slab</b> or tilt-wall is a type of building and a construction technique using concrete. Though it is a cost-effective technique with a shorter completion time, poor performance in earthquakes has mandated significant seismic retrofit requirements in older buildings.</p><p>With the tilt-up method, concrete elements (walls, columns, structural supports, etc.) are formed horizontally on a concrete slab; this normally requires the building floor as a building form but may be a temporary concrete casting surface near the building footprint. After the concrete has cured, the elements are ""tilted"" to the vertical position with a crane and braced into position until the remaining building structural components (roofs, intermediate floors and walls) are secured.</p><p>Tilt-up construction is a common method of construction throughout North America, several Caribbean nations, Australia, and New Zealand. It is not significantly used in Europe or the northern two thirds of Asia. It is gaining popularity in southern Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, Central and South America. </p><p>Concrete elements can also be formed at factories away from the building site. Tilt-up differs from prefabrication, or plant cast construction, in that all elements are constructed on the job site.

Hurricane shutter	<p><b>Hurricane coverings</b>, commonly known as <b>shutters</b>, are used in hurricane mitigation to protect houses and other structures from damage caused by storms. Hurricane shutters are used to prevent windows from being broken by flying objects during a storm. Although the negative pressure caused by high velocity wind flowing over a building roof can cause the roof to fail with the building envelope intact, broken windows allow the air pressure to rise inside a building, creating an even greater pressure difference, and increasing the likelihood of roof failure.</p><p>Shutters are frequently constructed from steel or aluminium, but homeowners sometimes use the low-cost alternative of plywood. The shutters are affixed to the outside of the building with screws, hurricane clips, or a track system.

Roughcast	<p><b>Roughcast</b> or <b>pebbledash</b> is a coarse plaster surface used on outside walls that consists of lime and sometimes cement mixed with sand, small gravel and often pebbles or shells. The materials are mixed into a slurry and are then thrown at the working surface with a trowel or scoop. The idea is to maintain an even spread, free from lumps, ridges or runs and without missing any background. Roughcasting incorporates the stones in the mix, whereas pebbledashing adds them on top. </p><p>According to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> Eleventh Edition (1910–1911), roughcast had been a widespread exterior coating given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings, but it was then frequently employed for decorative effect on country houses, especially those built using timber framing (half timber). Variety can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles of different colours, and in the Tudor period fragments of glass were sometimes embedded.</p><p>Though it is an occasional home-design fad, its general unpopularity in the UK today is estimated to reduce the value of a property by up to 5%. However roughcasting remains very popular in Scotland and rural Ireland, with a high percentage of new houses being built with roughcasting.</p><p>This exterior wall finish was made popular in England and Wales during the 1920s, when housing was in greater demand, and house builders were forced to cut costs wherever they could, and used pebbledash to cover poor quality brick work, which also added rudimentary weather protection. </p><p>Pebbles were dredged from the seabed to provide the building material needed, although most modern pebbledash is actually not pebbles at all, but small and sharp flint chips, and should correctly be called Spar dash or spa dash. </p><p>There are several varieties of this spar dash such as Canterbury spar, sharp-dash, sharpstone dash, thrown dash, pebble stucco, Derbyshire Spar, Yellow spar, golden gravel, black and white, and also sunflower. </p> <p>According to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> Eleventh Edition, the central tower of St Albans Cathedral, built with Roman tiles from Verulamium, was covered with roughcast believed to be as old as the building.

Earthquake-resistant structures	<p><b>Earthquake-resistant or aseismic structures</b> are designed to protect buildings to some or greater extent from earthquakes. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of earthquake-resistant construction is to erect structures that fare better during Seismic activity than their conventional counterparts. According to building codes, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.</p><p>To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively stiff and strong. </p><p>Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Acropolis Museum.</p>	deformation offer these control conventional most minimize construction survive more threat protect by probability are intended preventing last engineering past cathedral facility equipping onesto heritage technique fare seismic rare from required structure can wa enough likely an cultural range this loss method destruction currently designed be according result architect should several location for simulation advanced application building former code minimal earthquake activity functionality that while observation typically expensive erect certain frequent earthquakeresistant often such them extent force entirely applied of site there is acceptable technology shaking excessively damage design it interest strong museum landmark base life aseismic some angel better at acropolis performance goal combat stiff their no a occur use mean build isolation using sizing structural limited or example ancient philosophy largest and appropriately withstand computer the important than to vibration immune during counterpart minimized available only any ductile experimental collapse making with our lady in greater	structures designed to protect buildings from earthquakes	protect building to earthquake from designed structure	Building

The IBC addresses both health and safety concerns for buildings based upon prescriptive and performance related requirements. The IBC is fully compatible with all other published ICC codes. The code provisions are intended to protect public health and safety while avoiding both unnecessary costs and preferential treatment of specific materials or methods of construction. However, a 2019 New York Times story revealed a secret agreement with the National Association of Home Builders that allowed the industry group, which represents the construction industry, to limit improvements in the code that would make buildings more environmentally sustainable and resistant to natural disasters, prompting a congressional investigation. The ICC, in response to a Congressional inquiry, vehemently denied the characterization of the agreement, noting, ""While home builders are among [our code development] partners, they do not have disproportionate control of the Code Council's model code development process.

Powder coating	<p><b>Powder coating</b> is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. Unlike conventional liquid paint which is delivered via an evaporating solvent, powder coating is typically applied electrostatically and then cured under heat or with ultraviolet light. The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminium extrusions, drum hardware, automobiles, and bicycle frames. Advancements in powder coating technology like UV curable powder coatings allow for other materials such as plastics, composites, carbon fiber, and MDF (medium-density fibreboard) to be powder coated due to the minimum heat and oven dwell time required to process these components.</p>	component these fibreboard conventional unlike type plastic time like used uv ultraviolet household other material mdf required coating an due be for that typically light polymer allow hard such liquid via create evaporating applied of advancement drum mediumdensity which extrusion freeflowing then is thermoplastic technology curable hardware composite it finish appliance metal powder dry thermoset electrostatically usually heat mainly frame under a delivered aluminium may bicycle or carbon solvent and fiber process paint the cured than to dwell tougher automobile oven with minimum coated in	coating applied as a free-flowing, dry powder	powder dry freeflowing applied a coating	Building
Rainscreen	<p>A <b>rainscreen</b> is an exterior wall detail where the siding (wall cladding) stands off from the moisture-resistant surface of an air/water barrier applied to the sheathing to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation. The <i>rainscreen</i> is the cladding or siding itself but the term rainscreen implies a system of building. Ideally the rainscreen prevents the wall air/water barrier from getting wet but because of cladding attachments and penetrations (such as windows and doors) water is likely to reach this point, and hence materials are selected to be moisture tolerant and integrated with flashing. In some cases a rainscreen wall is called a <i>pressure-equalized rainscreen</i> wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize on both sides of the rain screen, but this name has been criticized as being redundant and is only useful to scientists and engineers. </p>	exterior airwater attachment case cladding selected surface capillary term itself are redundant reach large material where from wall enough likely an stand useful this point engineer be pressureequalized for integrated ideally wet ventilation building equalize getting off water flashing opening because nearly prevents allow such barrier create applied been of both is sheathing but on implies scientist side break drainage some air door moistureresistant a being pressure evaporation rain or hence criticized and siding system the penetration to called only rainscreen window ha moisture tolerant with name screen in detail	form of exterior wall cladding	exterior cladding form of wall	Building

Passive daylighting	"<p><b>Daylighting</b> is the practice of placing windows, skylights, other openings, and reflective surfaces so that sunlight (direct or indirect) can provide effective internal lighting. Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from passive solar heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming/switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting. </p><p>The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation. Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter. </p><p>The source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. ""Direct sunlight"" reaches a site without being scattered within Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is ""diffused daylight"". Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. There is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall (north-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and south-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere) of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn.</p><p>Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summer), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.</p>"	these higher nearer human sometimes calculation proportion aim house more distribution also cast by surface scattered northern shadow sunlight reduced equatorialside are reach tropic directional saving other vernal face visual sun from where wall can benefit without passive an low comfort adjacent this presence engineer day ground effective same equatorial be quality designed area solar architect cloud equinox reflective location were designing building highly partially calculate those equator attention minimal when pipe off that direct southfacing incidence polarside opening each while northfacing polar given provide somewhat impact light simply pole except response allow undertaking east such lighting they placing achieved summertime larger even year of received eye midwinter composition site southern strategy earth there is but so sunny appear west on particular facing south side source coverage radiance internal reflected – space nonlinear electric some different room energy diffusion brighter skylight at automatically maximize least daylight diffused a no grid use capricorntraditionally long may fairly in analyzed all being reduce summer dimmingswitching within or hemisphere installing present diffuse cancer and fewer amount practice factor quickly receive heating make autumnal indirect process tube artificial latitude computer toward known climate illuminance vary the than to during any window program ha harvesting with contributes north through atmosphere measuring design ameliorated daylighting	practice of using daylight in building by windows or other openings	practice using window building by other or daylight opening of in	Building

Awning	<p>An <b>awning</b> or <b>overhang</b> is a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building. It is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic, cotton or polyester yarn, or vinyl laminated to polyester fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium, iron or steel, possibly wood or transparent material (used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer, but that must allow as much light as possible in the winter). The configuration of this structure is something of a truss, space frame or planar frame. Awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting. These aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor. </p><p>The location of an awning on a building may be above a window, a door, or above the area along a sidewalk. With the addition of columns an awning becomes a canopy, which is able to extend further from a building, as in the case of an entrance to a hotel. Restaurants often use awnings broad enough to cover substantial outdoor area for outdoor dining, parties, or reception. In commercial buildings, an awning is often painted with information as to the name, business, and address, thus acting as a sign or billboard as well as providing shade, breaking strong winds, and protecting from rain or snow. In areas with wintry weather, most awnings do not have to be taken down at the end of the summer – they can remain retracted against the building all winter long, or be designed and built for those conditions. </p> 	exterior case restaurant stretched these above fabric most able also tightly used party extend awning are overhang must well material where from wall structure enough can protecting an possible this polyester be designed over area solar built taken location for attached much application building wind substantial acting those remain when composed that reception dining billboard canvas breaking outdoor typically light broad secondary allow along laminated transparent often acrylic thermal information they business of thus constructed practical commercial which shade is addition but cover on it end strong iron – space do sidewalk yarn providing steel door load address at frame further column a sheeting use aluminium long may summer something wintry all canopy rain or not covering have and factor panel down weather hotel wood sign becomes the condition retracted against to winter entrance cotton woven planar truss window understucture possibly with vinyl name painted in snow configuration	secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building	the exterior attached building to secondary a of covering wall	Building

Underfloor air distribution	<p><b>Underfloor air distribution</b> (UFAD) is an air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning in buildings as part of the design of a HVAC system. UFAD systems use an underfloor supply plenum located between the structural concrete slab and a raised floor system to supply conditioned air through floor diffusers directly into the occupied zone of the building. UFAD systems are similar to conventional overhead systems (OH) in terms of the types of equipment used at the cooling and heating plants and primary air-handling units (AHU). Key differences include the use of an underfloor air supply plenum, warmer supply air temperatures, localized air distribution (with or without individual control) and thermal stratification. Thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristics of UFAD systems, which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems (OH). UFAD cooling load profile is different from a traditional OH system due to the impact of raised floor, particularly UFAD may have a higher peak cooling load than that of OH systems. This is because heat is gained from building penetrations and gaps within the structure itself. UFAD has several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems, including layout flexibility, improved thermal comfort and ventilation efficiency, reduced energy use in suitable climates and life-cycle costs. UFAD is often used in office buildings, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where raised floors are desirable for cable management. UFAD is appropriate for a number of different building types including commercials, schools, churches, airports, museums, libraries etc. Notable buildings using UFAD system in North America include The New York Times Building, Bank of America Tower and San Francisco Federal Building. Careful considerations need to be made in the construction phase of UFAD systems to ensure a well-sealed plenum to avoid air leakage in UFAD supply plenums. </p>	highlyreconfigurable higher control plan conventional number construction type distribution located between time used gained office gap term made federal itself are reduced conditioning allows characteristic underfloor church overhead unit thermostat suitable library from where open part structure without an include due comfort this layout be including francisco over several for ventilation building etc ahu that potential school ufad because improved plant impact efficiency cable raised individual tower profile flexibility often lifecycle stratification need thermal zone san supply desirable compared of commercial strategy which localized is traditional concrete equipment cost design america phase museum airhandling difference advantage similar space careful providing air different notable energy consideration ensure load heat at setpoints bank temperature particularly new a use primary peak may in using wellsealed structural within into or diffuser management airport york have plenum and one directly floor heating avoid appropriate climate system warmer the oh penetration than to featured slab leakage ha conditioned hvac key with through north occupied cooling	air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning	for and strategy ventilation space providing air conditioning distribution	Building

Radiant cooling	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Radiant heating and cooling</b> is a category of HVAC technologies that exchange heat by both convection and radiation with the environments they are designed to heat or cool. There are many subcategories of radiant heating and cooling, including: ""radiant ceiling panels"", ""embedded surface systems"", ""thermally active building systems"", and infrared heaters. According to some definitions, a technology is only included in this category if radiation comprises more than 50% of its heat exchange with the environment; therefore technologies such as radiators and chilled beams (which may also involve radiation heat transfer) are usually not considered radiant heating or cooling. Within this category, it is practical to distinguish between high temperature radiant heating (devices with emitting source temperature &gt;≈300 °F), and radiant heating or cooling with more moderate source temperatures. This article mainly addresses radiant heating and cooling with moderate source temperatures, used to heat or cool indoor environments. Moderate temperature radiant heating and cooling is usually composed of relatively large surfaces that are internally heated or cooled using hydronic or electrical sources.

Green building	<p><b>Green building</b> (also known as <b>green construction</b> or <b>sustainable building</b>) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. In doing so, the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., planet, people and profit across the entire supply chain need to be considered.</p><p>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia. </p><p>Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels. </p><p>Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by: </p> <ul><li>Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</li> <li>Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)</li> <li>Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation</li></ul><p>A similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction. </p><p>A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance.

Heat recovery ventilation	<p><b>Heat recovery ventilation</b> (<b>HRV</b>), also known as <b>mechanical ventilation heat recovery</b> (<b>MVHR</b>), is an energy recovery ventilation system which works between two sources at different temperatures. Heat recovery is a method which is used to reduce the heating and cooling demands of buildings. By recovering the residual heat in the exhaust gas, the fresh air introduced into the air conditioning system is pre-heated (pre-cooled) and the fresh air enthalpy is increased (reduced) before the fresh air enters the room or the air cooler of the air conditioning unit performs heat and moisture treatment. A typical heat recovery system in buildings consists of a core unit, channels for fresh air and exhaust air and blower fans. Building exhaust air is used as either a heat source or heat sink depending on the climate conditions, time of year and requirements of the building. Heat recovery systems typically recover about 60–95% of the heat in exhaust air and have significantly improved the energy efficiency of buildings .</p>	recovering consists between time also used by channel fan reduced conditioning unit mechanical an enters exhaust increased recovery method for ventilation building demand either improved mvhr typically efficiency enthalpy hrv two year of before which is fresh on introduced source cooler about different air room significantly energy heat at temperature recover a reduce residual into or requirement sink preheated have depending and precooled work heating known climate system the condition blower to performs gas treatment core typical moisture 60–95 in cooling	collective term for the procedere of reusing thermal energy	for the reusing collective term of thermal procedere energy	Building

Zero-energy building	"<p>A <b>Zero Energy Building</b> (ZEB), also known as a <b>Net Zero Energy</b> (NZE) building, or a <b>Zero Net Energy</b> (ZNE) building, is a building with net zero energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site or in other definitions by renewable energy sources offsite, using technology such as heat pumps, high efficiency windows and insulation, and solar panels. The goal is that these buildings contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere during operations than similar non-ZNE buildings. They do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases, but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount. Zero-energy buildings are not only driven by a want to have less of an impact on the environment, but they are also driven by money.

Passive cooling	<p><b>Passive cooling</b> is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or no energy consumption. This approach works either by preventing heat from entering the interior (heat gain prevention) or by removing heat from the building (natural cooling).</p><p>Natural cooling utilizes on-site energy, available from the natural environment, combined with the architectural design of building components (e.g. building envelope), rather than mechanical systems to dissipate heat. Therefore, natural cooling depends not only on the architectural design of the building but on how the site's natural resources are used as heat sinks (i.e. everything that absorbs or dissipates heat). Examples of on-site heat sinks are the upper atmosphere (night sky), the outdoor air (wind), and the earth/soil. </p><p>Passive cooling is an important tool for design of buildings for climate change adaptation – reducing dependency on energy-intensive air conditioning in warming environments.</p>	component control order prevention used by coolingnatural adaptation improve entering interior are therefore preventing conditioning night warming indoor from absorbs passive mechanical an low comfort this approach eg for ie depends wind building onsite natural change reducing that either outdoor utilizes dissipate dissipates upper thermal of environment sky site is but architectural rather resource consumption on design removing focus gain envelope – air tool energy dependency heat energyintensive a no dissipation or not example sink and everything earthsoil work climate combined system the important than to available only how with atmosphere in cooling	any cooling method that facilitates heat dissipation without additional energy input	heat additional dissipation without facilitates input method energy that cooling any	Building

Passive house	"<p><b>Passive house</b> (German: <i lang=""de"">Passivhaus</i>) is a voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building, which reduces the building's ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, MINERGIE-P, is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design. Although it is principally applied to new buildings, it has also been used for refurbishments. </p><p>By late 2008, estimates of the number of Passive house buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures.

Heliotrope (building)	"<p>The <b>Heliotrope</b> is a design of environmentally friendly housing by the German architect Rolf Disch. Three such buildings exist in Germany, the first experimental version was built in 1994 as the architect's home in Freiburg im Breisgau, while the other two are used as exhibition buildings for the Hansgrohe company in Offenburg and a dentist's lab in Hilpoltstein in Bavaria. </p><p>The Heliotrope in Freiburg was the first building in the world to capture more energy than it uses, all of which is entirely renewable, emissions free and CO<sub>2</sub> neutral. The structure physically rotates to track the sun, which allows it to harness the maximum natural sunlight and warmth possible. Several different energy generation modules are used in the building including a 603 sq ft (56.0 m<sup>2</sup>) dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel, a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar-thermal balcony railings to provide heat and warm water. These innovations in combination with the superior insulation of the residence allow the Heliotrope to capture anywhere between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year. The Heliotrope is also fitted with a grey-water cleansing system and built-in natural waste composting. </p><p>At the same time that Freiburg’s Heliotrope was built, Hansgrohe contracted Disch's architecture practice to design and build another Heliotrope to be used as a visitor’s center and showroom in Offenburg, Germany. A third Heliotrope was then contracted and built in Hilpoltstein, Bavaria to be used as a technical dental laboratory. Disch's unique design accommodates different utilization from private residences to laboratories, and nevertheless maintains the structure's positive energy balance.</p><p>In addition to the original Heliotrope design, Disch has drawn plans for larger versions of the project to be built as a rotating hotel, which gives every guest a ""beautiful view"", as well as administrative buildings and even an exhibition pavilion for the EXPO 2010 in Shanghai.</p> <p> Disch also designed the <i>Sonnenschiff</i> office complex. </p>"	these plan breisgau showroom free give us more between time also used by office housing laboratory neutral solarthermal sunlight cleansing are allows expo shanghai co2 other unit version well contracted sun utilization from renewable structure generation wa an possible bavaria drawn same architecture including superior be designed architect 603 built hansgrohe several for physically solar rolf exchanger complex building project dentist natural company usage guest insulation emission water that visitor heliotrope unique chp private view anywhere another capture third while provide s ft german photovoltaic geothermal freiburg tracking technical allow dental such two rotates larger even entirely m2 year of nevertheless three disch railing six which maximum module dualaxis is builtin then addition germany residence beautiful on composting four it combination track balancein 2010 different dischs hilpoltstein sq energy administrative exist innovation original heat at ’ greywater im a power build warmth all lab waste rotating pavilion every accommodates depending and center panel practice fitted first positive offenburg friendly hotel combined system harness the balcony than to warm sonnenschiff world home environmentally maintains experimental ha 1994 with 560 in design exhibition	building in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany	freiburg building breisgau im germany in	Building

Buildings that have been assessed and are deemed to meet a certain level of performance and quality, receive a certificate proving this achievement.</p><p>According to the Global Status Report 2017 published by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in coordination with the International Energy Agency (IEA), buildings and construction activities together contribute to 36% of the global energy use and 39% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Through certification, the associated environmental impacts during the lifecycle of buildings and other infrastructures (typically design, construction, operation and maintenance) could be better understood and mitigated. Currently, more than 100 building certifications systems exist around the world. The most popular building certification models today are BREEAM (UK), LEED (US), and DGNB (Germany).</p>	rating aim most 2017 construction certificate more used by integrate improve are sustainability co2 other unep from popular perspective development this approach currently be quality building project activity dioxide emission coordination that could ass impact typically certain together dgnb industry lifecycle such mitigated overall been uk of infrastructure environment environmental 100 deemed today set achievementaccording germany international proving report it around life certification promote global tool energy maintenance exist better level assessed contribute u performance goal nation a use cycle or 39 carbon have and receive green meet leed sustainable system 36 united the iea understood than to world during breeam programme published operation with fulfillment model through associated status in agency design	rating system or tool used to assess a building or a construction project's performance from a sustainability and environmental perspective	sustainability and perspective used rating building to performance or project ass tool a construction from environmental system	Building
Arborloo	<p>An <b>arborloo</b> is a simple type of composting toilet in which feces are collected in a shallow pit and a fruit tree is later planted in the fertile soil of the full pit. Arborloos have: a pit like a pit latrine but less deep; a concrete, ferrocement or other strong floor; a superstructure (toilet house or outhouse) to provide privacy; and possibly a ring beam to protect the pit from collapsing. The pit should remain well above the water table in the soil, so as to not contaminate groundwater. </p><p>The arborloo works by temporarily putting the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while it fills. Feces, urine, paper, leaves, other materials for wiping, and potentially anal wash water all go into the pit. After each use, a cup of the excavated soil should be added to help to control smell and flies. When the pit is nearly full, the outhouse and slab are moved to a newly dug pit and the old pit is covered with some of the earth from the new pit and left to compost. A fruit tree or other useful vegetation is planted in the old pit, preferably during the rainy season.</p><p>Feces are safely stored and converted in the soil, avoiding disease transmission, and do not have to be processed or manipulated by anyone. Instead, fruits on trees are grown, fertilised by human excreta. </p><p>The arborloo is a type of dry toilet. By using the nutrient-rich soil of a retired pit, the arborloo, in effect, treats feces as a resource rather than a waste product. Arborloos are used in rural areas of many developing countries, for example in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Ethiopia.</p>	toilet fly outhouse control above human type old converted beam fill like protect used by excreta full leaf moved are latrine fruit contaminate tree other well disease instead material from added go anal an processed useful be area should wiping for temporarily cup many stored collected remain simple ring when preferably groundwater water later each while effect provide nearly seasonfeces product arborloo after ethiopia rural shallow fertilised malawi help of le newly planted which covered soil vegetation earth is but collapsing so anyone resource rather concrete urine composting on left pit superstructure it arborloos strong avoiding smell do some dry wash grown new a deep use feces manipulated privacy in all using paper into or waste not transmission example fertile have table and retired excavated work floor putting safely developing potentially treat rainy country the than to compost during slab dug possibly with ferrocement house nutrientrich zimbabwe	simple type of composting toilet in which feces are collected in a shallow pit and a tree is later planted in the full pit	planted toilet which collected is simple type and composting later pit full are the tree shallow a of in feces	Building
Passive daylighting	"<p><b>Daylighting</b> is the practice of placing windows, skylights, other openings, and reflective surfaces so that sunlight (direct or indirect) can provide effective internal lighting. Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from passive solar heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming/switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight – a process known as daylight harvesting. </p><p>The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation. Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter. </p><p>The source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. ""Direct sunlight"" reaches a site without being scattered within Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is ""diffused daylight"". Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylight. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. There is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall (north-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and south-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere) of a building from the autumnal equinox to the vernal equinox at latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn.</p><p>Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summer), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.</p>"	these higher nearer human sometimes calculation proportion aim house more distribution also cast by surface scattered northern shadow sunlight reduced equatorialside are reach tropic directional saving other vernal face visual sun from where wall can benefit without passive an low comfort adjacent this presence engineer day ground effective same equatorial be quality designed area solar architect cloud equinox reflective location were designing building highly partially calculate those equator attention minimal when pipe off that direct southfacing incidence polarside opening each while northfacing polar given provide somewhat impact light simply pole except response allow undertaking east such lighting they placing achieved summertime larger even year of received eye midwinter composition site southern strategy earth there is but so sunny appear west on particular facing south side source coverage radiance internal reflected – space nonlinear electric some different room energy diffusion brighter skylight at automatically maximize least daylight diffused a no grid use capricorntraditionally long may fairly in analyzed all being reduce summer dimmingswitching within or hemisphere installing present diffuse cancer and fewer amount practice factor quickly receive heating make autumnal indirect process tube artificial latitude computer toward known climate illuminance vary the than to during any window program ha harvesting with contributes north through atmosphere measuring design ameliorated daylighting	practice of using daylight in building by windows or other openings	practice using window building by other or daylight opening of in	Building
Solar air heat	<p><b>Solar air heating</b> is a solar thermal technology in which the energy from the sun, insolation, is captured by an absorbing medium and used to heat air. Solar air heating is a renewable energy heating technology used to heat or condition air for buildings or process heat applications. It is typically the most cost-effective out of all the solar technologies, especially in commercial and industrial applications, and it addresses the largest usage of building energy in heating climates, which is space heating and industrial process heating. </p><p>Solar air collectors can be divided into two categories:</p> <ul><li>Unglazed Air Collectors or Transpired Solar Collector (used primarily to heat ambient air in commercial, industrial, agriculture and process applications)</li> <li>Glazed Solar Collectors (recirculating types that are usually used for space heating)</li></ul>	for all which application commercial building primarily into or is most usage type that technology and largest used by costeffective heating category process it agriculture medium are captured climate typically glazed the ambient condition space to out sun air especially from thermal two renewable energy usually can absorbing recirculating an address heat unglazed transpired industrial a insolation collector of be divided in solar	use of sunlight for air heating with a solar thermal collector	for heating with air a collector sunlight of use thermal solar	Building
Baubotanik	<p><b>Baubotanik</b> is a term that describes a building method in which architectural structures are created through the interaction of technical joints and plant growth. The term entails the practice of designing and building living structures using <i>living plants</i>. In this regard, living and non-living elements are intertwined in such a way that they grow together into plant-technical composite structures.</p><p>The Baubotanik method combines the aesthetic and ecological qualities of living trees with the static functions and structural requirements of buildings, thereby reducing the need for artificial building materials. The structures provide valuable habitats for a variety of animal species and make conventional foundations redundant, due to their root anchorage.</p><p>The use of Baubotanik is not a new invention and can be found in various historical and cultural contexts, such as the <i>Tanzlinden</i> (“dancing lime”) tree in Germany and living root bridge in North-East India. Common in the Indian state of Meghalaya and grown by the Khasi and Jaintia, the bridges consist of the aerial roots of rubber fig trees (Ficus elastica) and are grown over rivers to form walkable bridges. While the process can take fifteen years to complete, the bridges can be reinforced with natural materials and can withstand the strongest tropical storms. Furthermore, since the turn of the millennium, ‘willow churches’ (made of willow rods and lacking a fixed roof) have been constructed on various former garden show grounds, yet provide only limited functionality as buildings.</p>	fig conventional northeast interaction turn by roof term foundation made are redundant joint consist church lime tree material describes aerial grow structure can cultural “ india due this indian since bridge method ground be quality over for designing intertwined context dancing building furthermore former natural planttechnical root reducing functionality that rod river yet form while plant anchoragethe provide valuable millennium technical together take habitat complete need such living tropical invention entail they ficus baubotanik been year of constructed strongest ‘ which function is jaintia tanzlinden germany architectural ” on composite static growth way regard lacking ecological elastica willow nonliving fixed garden state combine ’ grown structuresthe new meghalaya a animal their created use using element structural found into limited requirement not variety have and various practice make fifteen aesthetic process artificial withstand thereby historical rubber the to reinforced common show only storm specie walkable with through khasi in	building term	building term	Building
Green wall	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p>A <b>green wall</b> is a vertical built structure intentionally covered by vegetation. Green walls include a vertically applied growth medium such as soil, substitute substrate, or hydroculture felt; as well as an integrated hydration and fertigation delivery system. They are also referred to as <b>living walls</b> or <b>vertical gardens,</b> and widely associated with the delivery of many beneficial ecosystem services.</p><p>Green walls differ from the more established vertical greening typology of 'green facades' as they have the growth medium supported on the vertical face of the host wall (as described below), while green facades have the growth medium only at the base (either in a container or as a ground bed). Green facades typically support climbing plants that climb up the vertical face of the host wall, while green walls can accommodate a variety of plant species. Green walls may be implanted indoors or outdoors; as freestanding installations or attached to existing host walls; and applied in a variety of sizes. </p><p>Stanley Hart White, a Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois from 1922 to 1959, patented a 'vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System' in 1938, though his invention did not progress beyond prototypes in his backyard in Urbana, Illinois. The popularising of green walls is often credited to Patrick Blanc, a French botanist specialised in tropical forest undergrowth. He worked with architect Adrien Fainsilber and engineer Peter Rice to implement the first successful large indoor green wall or <i>Mur Vegetal</i> in 1986 at the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris, and has since been involved with the design and implementation of a number of notable installations (e.g. Musée du quai Branly, collaborating with architect Jean Nouvel). </p><p>Green walls have seen a surge in popularity in recent times.

Building insulation	<p><b>Building insulation</b> is any object in a building used as insulation for thermal management. While the majority of insulation in buildings is for thermal purposes, the term also applies to acoustic insulation, fire insulation, and impact insulation (e.g. for vibrations caused by industrial applications). Often an insulation material will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once. </p><p>Insulation is an important economic and environmental investment for buildings. By installing insulation, buildings use less energy for heating and cooling and occupants experience less thermal variability. Retrofitting buildings with further insulation is an important climate change mitigation tactic, especially in geographies where energy production is carbon-intensive. Local and national governments and utilities often have a mix of incentives and regulations to encourage insulation efforts on new and renovated buildings as part of efficiency programs in order to reduce grid energy use and its related environmental impacts and infrastructure costs. </p>	investment these mix order renovated also used by object term variability material where part an industrial eg tactic be national several for application building economic will change insulation incentive production related while ability local impact efficiency encourage often regulation thermal geography experience of infrastructure le environmental function is on effort occupant cost acoustic it government utility energy at perform carbonintensive further new a grid use once in reduce caused management installing fire have and majority retrofitting heating climate the important mitigation to vibration especially applies purpose any program with chosen cooling	material used to  thermally insulate buildings	insulate thermally used building to material	Building

Passive ventilation	"<p><b>Passive ventilation</b> is the process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using mechanical systems. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure differences arising from natural forces. </p><p>There are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: <i>wind driven ventilation</i> and <i>buoyancy-driven ventilation</i>. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.</p><p>Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes, including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called ""breathing buildings"". </p>"	exterior sometimes perimeter arises permit type between driven by interior are directional indoor breathing from structure without passive an mechanical including result formed supplying ventilation building wind natural that opening buoyancy effect two force create of exteriorsince which occurs there then is on external it removing internal difference gain buoyancydriven around space air different naturally heat temperature a created being using pressure or and process system the to called flow arising occurring ventilated people variable through in refers	process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using mechanical systems	and an mechanical using supplying space to indoor process air removing from of system without	Building
Compressed earth block	<p>A <b>compressed earth block</b> (<b>CEB</b>), also known as a <b>pressed earth block</b> or a <b>compressed soil block</b>, is a building material made primarily from an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic subsoil, non-expansive clay, sand, and aggregate. Forming compressed earth blocks requires dampening, mechanically pressing at high pressure, and then drying the resulting material. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as Portland cement they are called <i>compressed stabilized earth block</i> (CSEB) or <i>stabilized earth block</i> (SEB). Typically, around 3,000 psi (21 MPa) is applied in compression, and the original material volume is reduced by about half. </p><p>Creating CEBs differs from rammed earth in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from mud bricks in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB usually exceeds that of typical mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB. </p><p>CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard bricklaying and masonry techniques. The mortar may be a simple slurry made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues.

Green building in Bangladesh	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations in the world due to climate change. As the ninth most populous country and twelfth most densely populated countries in the world, its rising population and limited land space have put tremendous strains on the urban ecosystem. The capital of Dhaka itself underwent severe transformations in recent years to catch up the increased rate of urbanisation. This change was paralleled by a boom in the real estate, construction and housing industry. According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world.</p><p>Unified measures have been adopted from the national community in an effort to avoid further man made calamities due to climate change and higher emissions. There are six main sectors most likely to be affected by climate change in Bangladesh – water resources and coastal zones, infrastructure and human settlements, agriculture and food security, forestry and biodiversity, fisheries, and human health. Deforestation has resulted in several man made disasters in the country's history. Green buildings assure efficient usage of water and energy and the nation is struggling in the production of electricity and suffering from a shortage of water. </p><p>The First Government Green Building Initiative was taken by the Housing and Building Research Institute in 2007The Eco-Housing Project designed by Ar. Md Nafizur Rahman. With the support of IFC-world bank the HBRI Drafted the Guideline for Grenbuilding Code in 2012, in the same year a new chapter on Energy Efficiency and Sustainability was included in BNBC. The Building Energy and Environment Rating System for Bangladesh has been Drafted by Ar. Md. Nafizur Rahman in 2018 for the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Authority (SREDA)[1] The Bangladesh Bank with te support of SREDA also created a point-based rating system for their Refinancing scheme in 2017. In the private sector, the first green building in Bangladesh was by EPIC group in May 2011. Since 2008, Sustainable Built Environment Initiative – Bangladesh (later Bangladesh Green Building Council) founder, Sanwar Azam had worked to unify the stake holders towards a greener country, saying that with growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanisation to major cities, 'Going green' had become a marketing ploy for various organisations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability. He offered a centralised board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms. In addition, he proposed a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture.</p><p>Azam also stressed the need for educational programs in sustainable designs and various universities in Bangladesh planned to promote Green Building principles in their curriculum, such as in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, State University of Bangladesh-SUB, North South University, BRAC University and Asia Pacific University. Dr. Saleh Uddin was the Events and Education Committee of Bangladesh Green Building Council. Citing that in cramped environment, such buildings and structures would be far more comfortable and satisfying but most importantly directly address some national issues, like conserving water and energy. The Government of Bangladesh in 2009 stopped giving connections to newly constructed buildings meaning that new homes would not have access to energy, and even water due to shortages. Experts agreed that a rating tool would not only facilitate government incentives to sustainable communities but achieve the six-point goals of the National Water Policy of 1999 by the World Bank as well as the Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 by the Ministry of Power and Energy.</p><p>In an event with Architecture and construction experts, he urged for a national need for sustainable development in the nation's growing building industry and brought a forum together to act as the national GBC of Bangladesh. He stressed reductions of carbon emissions from buildings. National and international energy companies like Energpac and Siemens attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative. The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the seventh target from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as for the first time the council provided support for green building certifications. Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. In another interview with <i>The Independent</i>, Sanwar said ""there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction,"" and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. About the feasibility of widespread utilisation of LEED certifications, he said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context. These activities were also promoted by national and region experts. Prominent national award-winning architects such as Mustapha Khalid Palash, the 2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and Rafiq Azam, defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define 'Green' according to the national circumstances. The Institute of Architects Bangladesh, which works with different government organisation to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool.</p><p>In 2011, BGBC founder pointed out that such green building standards and tools will lead to conservation as buildings would less consumption of electricity and water, and also 'the need for reduction of carbon emissions' in the current building and construction scenario. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh spoke about the government's role. By 2012, the Ministry of Public Works began working with the World Bank to study energy and water efficiency and emissions reductions through Green Building Codes.</p>"	worked 2008 attended construction epic winner like history by housing sanwar group additional sreda1 deforestation renewable urban likely populated framework man great densely national taken bangladesh context much said code efficient project will change major minimal pointbased nafizur private polluted widespread while unify comfortable electricity outweighs severe up greener te been of productivity toolin is adopted sector grenbuilding feasibility convention region cramped space coastal some promote adaptability effectiveness energy mdgs attain market bank no created may sixpoint facilitate provided planned 2012 panel one rahman stopped stakeholder avoid importantly sustainable system founder the brought pointed sreda home initially populous with working dhaka higher security 2017 more initiative worldunified interview become itself competition sustainability siemens well from educational wa development be struggling built for land were holder company activity current emission citing incentive unfpa prominent later put shortage agriculture support centralised refinancing ifcworld industry judge chapter forestry zone board far even year rising which ministry addition estate but settlement seventh international resource technology energpac included effort independent affected chief it way similar event 2011 out different tool asia ninth conserving energyin address act a power principle issue cheaper brac green first quantifiable work research professional developing guideline authority interested commented diminishing ploy fund paralleled bnbc vulnerable calamity program meeting regional uddin suffering institute in underwent rating human plan tremendous md would biodiversity define ar rafiq advocacy engineering transformation urbanisation role stake since increased he designed several 2009 building recent very practicing usage capital water that curriculum population production target another scenario ass khalid transform cultureazam leadership city voluntary infrastructure le environmental six mustapha there access 2007the consumption on boom committee suited cost catch south lead hbri – about 2010 global fishery standard rapid 2018 marketing state saying goal further urged their limited agreed not various spoke directly ecohousing organisation leed reduction defined country condition step saleh 1999 giving measure only azam education ha study ecosystem aimed offered north through assure offer these most had real also time made palash are resulted holcim connection stressed twelfth university saving forum structure awardwinning an due this same effective architecture according architect unfccc regarding fellow pacific utilisation health imperative form efficiency millennium expensive corporate together firm misconception food need such drafted expert environment newly constructed proposed gbc meaning achieve promoted fulfill government certification community at growing main strain nation new disaster ipcc circumstance socioeconomic scheme policy carbon public going have dr began and intergovernmental bangladeshsub towards process climate relevant rate united council to chairman world bgbc conservation satisfying platform design initial	overview of green building in Bangladesh	bangladesh in green building of overview	Building

Phase-change material	<p>A <b>phase change material</b> (<b>PCM</b>) is a substance which releases/absorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heat/cooling. Generally the transition will be from one of the first two fundamental states of matter - solid and liquid - to the other. The phase transition may also be between non-classical states of matter, such as the conformity of crystals, where the material goes from conforming to one crystalline structure to conforming to another, which may be a higher or lower energy state. </p><p>The energy released/absorbed by phase transition from solid to liquid, or vice versa, the heat of fusion is generally much higher than the sensible heat. Ice, for example, requires 333.55 J/g to melt, but then water will rise one degree further with the addition of just 4.18 J/g. Water/ice is therefore a very useful phase change material and has been used to store winter cold to cool buildings in summer since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire. </p><p>By melting and solidifying at the phase change temperature (PCT), a PCM is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy compared to sensible heat storage. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa or when the internal structure of the material changes; PCMs are accordingly referred to as latent heat storage (LHS) materials. </p><p>There are two principal classes of phase change material: organic (carbon-containing) materials derived either from petroleum, from plants or from animals; and salt hydrates, which generally either use natural salts from the sea or from mineral deposits or are by-products of other processes. A third class is solid to solid phase change. </p><p>PCMs are used in many different commercial applications where energy storage and/or stable temperatures are required, including, among others, heating pads, cooling for telephone switching boxes, and clothing. </p><p>By far the biggest potential market is for building heating and cooling. In this application area, PCMs hold potential in light of the progressive reduction in the cost of renewable electricity, coupled with the intermittent nature of such electricity. This can result in a misfit between peak demand and availability of supply. In North America, China, Japan, Australia, Southern Europe and other developed countries with hot summers, peak supply is at midday while peak demand is from around 17:00 to 20:00. This creates opportunities for thermal storage media. </p><p>Solid-liquid phase change materials are usually encapsulated for installation in the end application, to contain in the liquid state. In some applications, especially when incorporation to textiles is required, phase change materials are micro-encapsulated. Micro-encapsulation allows the material to remain solid, in the form of small bubbles, when the PCM core has melted. </p>	stable sensible higher lh waterice switching crystalline released clothing opportunity latent between time also used by sea pad releasesabsorbs pcm storing sufficient medium are therefore allows nonclassical europe large other solidliquid fusion material from where go required structure renewable can principal midday referred useful since andor this biggest be including area vice pct derived result hold degree for nature installation much application building many microencapsulated very will versa remain change natural others when water potential store another third while form demand either plant among provide small light pcms salt electricity melting such two liquid melt thermal jg petroleum bubble storage incorporation 33355 achaemenid supply releasing substance far been compared generally of just 2000 box commercial which southern lower cold there then is hot addition but accordingly creates cost matter america end phase internal around misfit some progressive 1700 different organic china cool fundamental energy usually class state market requires heat at least hydrate temperature further coupled a animal use japan peak may availability in summer capable or ice byproduct example 418 contain transition mineral and amount deposit one first heating crystal telephone process microencapsulation reduction rise country the carboncontaining than to encapsulated winter especially conforming core heatcooling solidifying developed empire ha with releasedabsorbed solid melted intermittent north absorbed textile conformity australia cooling	substance with high latent heat of melting or solidifying	latent solidifying high heat substance or with melting of	Building

Climate change and cities	"<p> <b>Climate change and cities</b> are deeply connected. Cites are one of the greatest contributors and likely best opportunities for addressing climate change. Cities are also one of the most vulnerable parts of the human society to the effects of climate change, and likely one of the most important solutions for reducing the environmental impact of humans. More than half of the world's population is in cities, consuming a large portion of food and goods produced outside of cities. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. Hence, cities have a significant influence on construction and transportation—two of the key contributors to global warming emissions. Moreover, because of processes that create climate conflict and climate refugees, city areas are expected to grow during the next several decades, stressing infrastructure and concentrating more impoverished peoples in cities.</p><p>Because of the high density and effects like the urban heat island affect, weather changes due to climate change are likely to greatly effect cities, exacerbating existing problems, such as air pollution, water scarcity, and heat illness in the metropolitan areas. Moreover, because most cities have been built on rivers or coastal areas, cities are frequently vulnerable to the subsequent effects of sea level rise, which cause coastal flooding<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: SPM-33"">: SPM-33 </span></sup> and erosion, and those effects are deeply connected with other urban environmental problems, like subsidence and aquifer depletion. </p><p>A report by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group described consumption based emissions as having significantly more impact than production-based emissions within cities. The report estimates that 85% of the emissions associated with goods within a city is generated outside of that city. Climate change adaptation and mitigation investments in cities will be important in reducing the impacts of some of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions: for example, increased density allows for redistribution of land use for agriculture and reforestation, improving transportation efficiencies, and greening construction (largely due to cement's outsized role in climate change and improvements in sustainable construction practices and weatherization).In the most recent past, increasing urbanization has also been proposed as a phenomenon that has a reducing effect on the global rate of carbon emission primarily because with urbanization comes technical prowess which can help drive sustainability. Lists of high impact climate change solutions tend to include city-focused solutions; for example, Project Drawdown recommends several major urban investments, including improved bicycle infrastructure, building retrofitting, district heating, public transit, and walkable cities as important solutions.</p><p>Because of this, the international community has formed coalitions of cities (such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI) and policy goals, such as Sustainable Development Goal 11 (""sustainable cities and communities""), to activate and focus attention on these solutions. </p>"	greening investment subsidence these concentrating human cement most construction expected more opportunity also like sea by generated society adaptation coalition are allows large sustainability metropolitan warming group past increasing c40 subsequent other largely district role activate part grow 68 greatest urban density likely impoverished can live include due development this urbanization pollution increased next weatherizationin be including area built several for formed land prowess building those project will recent change major attention reducing emission cause best that water river flooding drive population produced citiesbecause because improved iclei deeply island agriculture effect described impact efficiency stressing exacerbating high outsized technical illness contributor aquifer addressing food leadership drawdown such half estimate un city create help existing been of infrastructure environmental cite greatly transportation which proposed phenomenon primarily scarcity is productionbased cityfocused international consumption on list report spm33 good portion transportation—two erosion outside decade focus frequently solution having coastal some influence global air depletion based significantly community level significant heat refugee 11 goal recommends greenhouse a transit use problem bicycle within hence or carbon public policy example 2050 have and largest moreover one practice retrofitting improvement heating reforestation process weather rise tend climate 85 sustainable rate the come important affect mitigation than to world gas improving during connected vulnerable people ha walkable key with redistribution solutionsbecause associated conflict in consuming	field of research combining climate change impact and mitigation and cities	and city mitigation research change combining of climate impact field	City
City	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>city</b> is a large human settlement. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. </p><p>Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and education. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming, and global health. Because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through Sustainable Development Goal 11. Due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change. However, this concentration can also have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources. </p><p>Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city.

Central business district	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>central business district</b> (<b>CBD</b>) is the commercial and business center of a city. It contains commercial space and offices. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's ""financial district"". Geographically, it often coincides with the ""city center"" or ""downtown"". However, these concepts are not mutually exclusive: many cities have a central <i>business</i> district located away from its commercial and or cultural center and or downtown/city center, or even several CBDs at once. The CBD is characterized as the area within a city with the highest accessibility plus having a greater variety and concentration of specialized goods and services than any other area. For instance, London's city center is usually regarded as encompassing the historic City of London and the medieval City of Westminster, while the City of London and the transformed Docklands area containing Canary Wharf are regarded as their two respective CBDs. In New York City, Midtown Manhattan. In Chicago, the Chicago Loop is the second-largest central business district in the United States and in the world. It is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. Mexico City also has its own historic city center, the colonial-era ""Centro Histórico,"" along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma – Polanco, and the new Santa Fe, respectively. Moscow and Russia's largest central business district is the Moscow International Business Center. </p><p>The shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the city center. This practice is quite common for European cities such as Paris, Moscow, or Vienna. In cities in the New World that grew quickly after the invention of modern transportation such as road or rail, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing urbanization in the 21st century have developed megacities, particularly in Asia, that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers. Although no two CBDs look alike in terms of their spatial shape, however, certain geometric patterns in these areas are recurring throughout many cities due to the nature of a centralized commercial and industrial activities.</p>"	these throughout most instance highest loop type multiple century westminster located polanco also history centralized office scattered shape spatial term downtowncity road are always therefore look distinct concept increasing historic district other preservation plus from regarded central midtown cultural urban financial tallest referred due this synonymous urbanization medieval industrial area canary several vienna for single rail nature many building la said will london conceptually service activity encompassing that russia midlate cbd contains while secondlargest distance almost respectively specialized restriction certain along often after such two paris 21st invention however mexico city larger business even characterized geographically docklands been of alike coincides chicago character transportation commercial maximum both is mutually international transformed height own good america quite it reforma closely modern paseo region colonialera strong containing having – space respective law asia usually downtown state centro european at particularly act new a their no recurring grew once fe geometric santa within or not york variety contain have reflect and center away largest practice quickly concentration although megacities united the moscow de understood than to pattern world retain common cbds core any histórico developed 20th wharf accessibility ha manhattan with across north in greater exclusive	commercial and business centre of a city	and centre commercial city business a of	City

It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India. The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats a large Hindu Shiva Temple. It is located central of the state, and 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, and was a point of contact for the Assyrians, Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English. </p><p>Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history. The city centre contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy. The city hosts the Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival in Kerala. The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan in April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'.</p><p>Religion is important and varied in Thrissur. The city has historically been a centre of Hindu scholarship, and Christianity, Islam and Judaism are believed to have entered the Indian subcontinent through Thrissur and its surrounding areas. Thrissur has a large number of well-known temples including the Vadakkumnathan temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, Paramekkavu temple, and Guruvayur temple. There are three major Catholic churches, the St. Antony's Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane, Our Lady of Lourdes Syro-Malabar Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral and Our Lady of Dolours Syro-Malabar Catholic Basilica, the largest Christian church in India. India's first mosque, Cheraman Juma Masjid, is believed to have been constructed in 629 CE.</p><p>The city is the headquarters of four major scheduled banks, South Indian Bank Ltd, Catholic Syrian Bank, Dhanalakshmi Bank and ESAF Small Finance Bank as well as several chit funds.

Suburb	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>suburb</b> (more broadly <b>suburban area</b>) is an area outside of a principal city of a metropolitan area, which may include commercial and mixed-use, but is primarily a residential area. A suburb can exist either as part of a larger city/urban area or as a separate political entity. The name describes an area which is not as densely populated as an inner city, yet more densely populated than a rural area in the countryside. In many metropolitan areas, suburbs exist as separate residential communities within commuting distance of a city (cf ""bedroom suburb"".) Suburbs can have their own political or legal jurisdiction, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom, where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities. In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, <i>suburb</i> has become largely synonymous with what is called a ""neighborhood"" in other countries, and the term encompasses inner city areas.</p><p>In some areas, such as Australia, India, China, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl. In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough. In the United States, regions beyond the suburbs are known as ""exurban areas"" or exurbs; exurbs have less population density than suburbs, but still more than rural areas. Suburbs and exurbs are linked to the nearby larger metropolitan area economically, particularly by commuters. </p><p>Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting. In general, they are less densely populated than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area, and most residents routinely commute to city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transits; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs, planned communities and satellite cities. Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.</p><p>In the United States, suburbs typically have the connotation of being more affluent, educated, and middle-class than city neighborhoods. Suburbs are often culturally distinct from the cities they orbit. The term ""suburbia"" is a mocking or slightly pejorative word for the mass culture of suburbs, calling to mind endless acres of single-family homes surrounded by carefully-mown lawns, with a culture that prizes middle-class conformity and frowns on differences and diversity. </p>"	case residential contrast commuting most encompasses france middleclass more mocking century located word exurbs by prize term connotation become road are always distinct large metropolitan kingdom affluent emerged other district largely county where from central describes abundance part frown can urban principal density an populated include india zealand adjacent this synonymous due municipality mind industrial morocco same densely including area result economically for rail inner much suburbia many pejorative remain jurisdiction others english that broadly canada private population yet increase improved either sprawl routinely distance typically areasin still culture suburban mass often rural such diversity locally conformity however resident they city via larger business exception exurban of le singlefamily led commercial which primarily calling there is englishspeaking carefullymown but separate own commuter on bedroom educated south region political mixeduse outside nearby endless difference 19th around proliferate vehicle some governed countryside suburb neighborhood china surrounded community administrative exist linked cityurban state entity particularly landin new general culturally a their transit may beyond being flat within boundary or public not planned have acre and center cf first slightly borough satellite tend defined known country united the than to called african especially home legal scale commute annexed what 20th ha lawn with name australian orbit in australia transport	residential or mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate area	mixed residential city or either a part of use area existing separate urban	City
Urbanity	<p><b>Urbanity</b> (<span></span>) may refer to suavity, courteousness, and refinement of manner, or to urban life. It represents characteristics, personality traits, and viewpoints associated with cities and urban areas. People who can be described as having urbanity are sometimes referred to as <i><b>citified</b></i>. The word is related to the Latin <i>urbanitas</i> with connotations of refinement and elegance, the opposite of <i>rusticus</i>, associated with the countryside. In Latin the word referred originally to the view of the world from ancient Rome. The name Urban has been taken as a papal name by nine popes and referred to the location of the Holy See at the Vatican in Rome and the pope's status as Bishop of Rome. <i>Urbane</i> has a similar meaning; <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> notes that the relationship of <i>urbane</i> to <i>urban</i> is similar to the relationship <i>humane</i> bears to <i>human</i>. </p><p>In language, <b>urbanity</b> still connotes a smooth and literate style, free of barbarisms and other infelicities.

Rural area	<p>In general, a <b>rural area</b> or a <b>countryside</b> is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. Agricultural areas and areas with forestry typically are described as rural. Different countries have varying definitions of <i>rural</i> for statistical and administrative purposes. </p><p>In rural areas, because of their unique economic and social dynamics, and relationship to land-based industry such as agriculture, forestry and resource extraction, the economics are very different from cities and can be subject to boom and bust cycles and vulnerability to extreme weather or natural disasters, such as droughts. These dynamics alongside larger economic forces encouraging to urbanization have led to significant demographic declines, called rural flight, where economic incentives encourage younger populations to go to cities for education and access to jobs, leaving older, less educated and less wealthy populations in the rural areas. Slower economic development results in poorer services like healthcare and education and rural infrastructure. This cycle of poverty in some rural areas, means that three quarters of the global population in poverty live in rural areas according to the Food and Agricultural Organization. </p><p>Some communities have successfully encouraged economic development in rural areas, with some policies such as giving increased access to electricity or internet, proving very successful on encouraging economic activities in rural areas. Historically development policies have focused on larger extractive industries, such as mining and forestry. However, recent approaches more focused on sustainable development are more aware of economic diversification in these communities. </p> 	diversification these younger successful more subject located like encouraged are social agricultural from where go density can live low development this urbanization approach increased be area result according town for economic very drought recent mining natural service activity incentive that older unique population because agriculture described healthcare small typically statistical alongside job electricity industry encourage food rural such forestry however city force larger of infrastructure le three led access is focused settlement resource proving demographic on extractive boom decline educated poorer outside organization some countryside global different quarter slower landbased administrative community aware significant general a their definition disaster mean vulnerability encouraging flight cycle or varying poverty policy economics have and leaving wealthy historically geographic weather sustainable bust country the to called typical purpose giving education internet relationship successfully extraction dynamic with extreme in	geographic area that is located outside towns and cities	and city is geographic outside area that town located	City

Town privileges	"<p><b>Town privileges</b> or <b>borough rights</b> were important features of European towns during most of the second millennium. The city law customary in Central Europe probably dates back to Italian models, which in turn were oriented towards the traditions of the self-administration of Roman cities. </p><p>Judicially, a borough (or burgh) was distinguished from the countryside by means of a charter from the ruling monarch that defined its privileges and laws. Common privileges involved trade (marketplace, the storing of goods, etc.) and the establishment of guilds. Some of these privileges were permanent and could imply that the town obtained the right to be called a borough, hence the term ""borough rights"" (German: <i lang=""de"">Stadtrecht</i>; Dutch: <i lang=""nl"">stadsrechten</i>). Some degree of self-government, representation by diet, and tax-relief could also be granted.

City region	<p><b>City region</b> is a term in use since about 1950 by urbanists, economists and urban planners to mean a metropolitan area and hinterland, often having a shared administration. Typically, it denotes a city, conurbation or urban zone with multiple administrative districts, but sharing resources like a central business district, labour market and transport network such that it functions as a single economic unit </p><p>In studying human geography, urban and regional planning or the regional dynamics of business it is often worthwhile to have closer regard to dominant travel patterns during the working day (to the extent that these can be estimated and recorded) than to the rather arbitrary boundaries assigned to administrative bodies such as councils, prefectures, or localities defined merely to optimise postal services. Inevitably, city regions change their shapes over time and quite reasonably, politicians seek to redraw administrative boundaries by perceived geographic reality. The extent of a city region is usually proportional to the intensity of activity in and around its central business district, but the spacing of competing centres of population can also be highly influential.

City status	"<p><b>City status</b> is a symbolic and legal designation given by a national or subnational government. A municipality may receive city status because it already has the qualities of a city, or because it has some special purpose. </p><p>Historically, city status was a privilege granted by royal letters of patent. The status would allow markets and/or foreign trade, in contrast to towns. Sovereigns could establish cities by decree, e.g. Helsinki, regardless of what was in the location beforehand. Also, with the establishment of federal governments, the new capital could be established from scratch, e.g. Brasília, without going through organic growth from a village to a town. </p> <p>British city status was historically conferred on settlements with a diocesan cathedral; in more recent times towns apply to receive city status at times of national celebration. In the United States <i>city</i> can be used for much smaller settlements. </p><p>The Government of China in 1982–1997 upgraded many counties to cities by decree, thereby increasing their city count from 250 to more than 650 during this period. Almost 15% of the counties in China became cities. The new ""cities"" may include large rural areas as well as urban areas.

Maya city	<p><b>Maya cities</b> were the centres of population of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of Mesoamerica. They served the specialised roles of administration, commerce, manufacturing and religion that characterised ancient cities worldwide. Maya cities tended to be more dispersed than cities in other societies, even within Mesoamerica, as a result of adaptation to a lowland tropical environment that allowed food production amidst areas dedicated to other activities. They lacked the grid plans of the highland cities of central Mexico, such as Teotihuacán and Tenochtitlan. Maya kings ruled their kingdoms from palaces that were situated within the centre of their cities. Cities tended to be located in places that controlled trade routes or that could supply essential products. This allowed the elites that controlled trade to increase their wealth and status. Such cities were able to construct temples for public ceremonies, thus attracting further inhabitants to the city. Those cities that had favourable conditions for food production, combined with access to trade routes, were likely to develop into the capital cities of early Maya states.</p><p>The political relationship between Classic Maya city-states has been likened to the relationships between city-states in Classical Greece and Renaissance Italy.

According to London's Metropolitan Police Force, ""Robbery, often called 'mugging', and thefts from victims in the street where their property is snatched and the victim is not assaulted is also considered 'street crime'."" </p><blockquote class=""templatequote""></blockquote> <p>Other examples of street crime include pickpocketing, the open illegal drugs trade, prostitution in the form of soliciting outside the law, the creation of graffiti and vandalism of public property, and assaults. As a generic term, street crime may include all of these, as well as offenses against private properties such as the stealing of hub caps. </p><p>The majority of street crimes, as portrayed by various news media, are initiated by criminals seeking quick financial gains. However, they can also be carried out by organized individuals with a common goal of profiteering. On the other hand, not all of these instances are considered by the FBI to be ""organized crimes"" due to the random nature of the crimes themselves. The term ""organized crime"" does not often include organized street crimes.</p><p>An organized crime is often a major business, consisting of many individuals associated for the common goal of criminal profiteering. In contrast, street crimes are normally conducted by hastily and loosely formed groups of individuals with the common goal of gaining illicit money through immediate criminal acts. </p>"	normally these fbi contrast instance between victim also by random term medium street are crime whitecollar nonviolent metropolitan portrayed group other well cap from where pickpocketing open can illegal financial hub gaining include vandalism due doe news be according area snatched nature for organized seeking robbery formed violence many prostitution carried london major assaulted hand immediate that private form place individual stealing crimesan theft industry often such consisting money however they assault force business drug mugging of themselves offense profiteering occurs is initiated on loosely generic outside government gain difference criminal property out law goal act a their conducted considered may loose quick all or public creation soliciting not example and various majority trade whereas the police against graffiti to called common purpose any with illicit associated through in hastily	criminal offense in a public place	public criminal place a in offense	City

Crossing sweeper	<p>A <b>crossing sweeper</b> was a person working as a street sweeper who would sweep a path ahead of people crossing dirty urban streets in exchange for a gratuity. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, and attitudes toward the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith. </p>	for greatly were feeling primarily found appreciation into artwork attitude public poor sweep that person century would and on practice also path dirty gratuity varied work nuisance by william exchange occupation it commentary among sweeper toward street way charles 19thcentury fiction focus intense the 19th ahead ranging to who during from crossing dickens powell urban wa popular an novel resident they city people this study presence frith a working their of including in fairly painting informal	Street cleaner	cleaner street	City

Costermonger	<p>A <b>costermonger</b>, <b>coster</b>, or <b>costard</b> is a street seller of fruit and vegetables in British towns. The term is derived from the words <i>costard</i> (a medieval variety of apple) and <i>monger</i> (seller), and later came to be used to describe hawkers in general. Some historians have pointed out that a hierarchy existed within the costermonger class and that while costermongers sold from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, mere hawkers carried their wares in a basket.</p><p>Costermongers met a need for rapid food distribution from the wholesale markets (e.g., in London: Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish) by providing retail sales at locations that were convenient for the labouring classes. Costermongers used a variety of devices to transport and display produce: a cart might be stationary at a market stall; a mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow) apparatus or a hand-held basket might be used for light-weight goods such as herbs and flowers. </p><p>Costermongers experienced a turbulent history, yet survived numerous attempts to eradicate their class from the streets. Programmes designed to curtail their activities occurred during the reigns of Elizabeth I, Charles I and reached a peak during Victorian times. However, the social cohesion within the coster community, along with sympathetic public support, enabled them to resist efforts to eradicate them. As highly visible, colourful characters who provided service and convenience to the labouring classes, costermongers enjoyed a high level of public sympathy at times when they came under attack from authorities. </p><p>They became known for their melodic sales patter, poems and chants, which they used to attract attention. Both the sound and appearance of costermongers contributed to a distinctive street life that characterised London and other large European cities, including Paris, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their loud sing-song cry or chants used to attract attention became part of the fabric of street life in large cities in Britain and Europe. Costermongers exhibited a distinct identity. Individuals signalled membership of the coster community through a dress code, especially the large neckerchief, known as a <i>kingsman</i>, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. The distinctive identity and culture of costermongers led to considerable appeal as subject-matter for artists, dramatists, comedians, writers and musicians. Parodies of the costermonger and his way of life were frequent features in Victorian music halls. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, but their numbers began to decline in the second half of the 20th century when they began to take up pitches in the regulated markets. </p>	met i hawker hall enabled fabric number basketcostermongers attack patter identity distribution handcart century neckerchief dramatist writer word time history used by term sale lightweight street music fruit seller large europe distinct eradicate considerable visible other occurred who social from basket cry part experienced britain wa comedian colourful medieval survived be eg apple british designed cohesion town derived including sympathy for location tied were elizabeth kingsman highly reign code carried london attention service activity when that billingsgate later smithfield poem mobile yet while stationary spitalfields resist support stall turbulent existed reached sympathetic high individual frequent culture distinctive ware along appeal take food need legendary such them paris up half handheld musician wheelbarrow however they city pitch of might retail curtail dress led character flower which signalled regulated both neck is sound round hierarchy numerous but produce decline came effort good herb device way charles parody 19th display life ubiquitous his feature labouring some out sold providing characterised community rapid historian class level market european england at general under a their convenience contributed peak chant describe within exhibited or public provided hostility meat midvictorian convenient variety have wholesale attempt began and apparatus vegetable towards appearance known second singsong loud the authority pointed cart police coster membership artist to during attract especially subjectmatter monger costermonger costard fish programme 20th melodic animaldrawn mere with horsedrawn through enjoyed became in victorian 18th transport	street seller of fruit and vegetables	and vegetable of street fruit seller	City
Street photography	<p><b>Street photography</b>, also sometimes called candid photography, is photography conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public places. Although there is a difference between street and candid photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some candid photography being classifiable as street photography. Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment. Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.</p> <p>The street photographer can be seen as an extension of the <i>flâneur</i>, an observer of the streets (who was often a writer or artist).</p><p>Framing and timing can be key aspects of the craft with the aim of some street photography being to create images at a decisive or poignant moment. </p><p>Street photography can focus on people and their behavior in public, thereby also recording people's history. This motivation entails having also to navigate or negotiate changing expectations and laws of privacy, security and property. In this respect the street photographer is similar to social documentary photographers or photojournalists who also work in public places, but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events; any of these photographers' images may capture people and property visible within or from public places. The existence of services like Google Street View, recording public space at a massive scale, and the burgeoning trend of self-photography (selfies), further complicate ethical issues reflected in attitudes to street photography. </p><p>However, street photography does not need to exclusively feature people within the frame. It can also focus on traces left by humanity that say something about life. Photographers such as William Eggleston often produce street photography where there are no people in the frame, but their presence is suggested by the subject matter. </p><p>Much of what is regarded, stylistically and subjectively, as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century through to the late 1970s, a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled candid photography in public places. </p>	security these human enabled sometimes most aim subjectively subject century between writer also history like by random object made facsimile street are classifiable visible moment observer who social where from regarded aspect urban can wa decisive an this craft doe presence definitive chance be candid nature for motivation much project documentary respect say service that recording incident view william capture place google expectation trace massive burgeoning often need such though entail however seen encounter selfies create late even of decidedly might environment trend character photography which there attitude is emergence selfphotography era but artistframing produce on left exclusively matter it spanning end saw enquiry focus difference 19th reflected life having feature similar space about event ethical some period property law poignant extension navigate usually capturing newsworthy absent at photojournalist frame further a their no art flâneur eggleston conducted may complicate stylistically being privacy humanity issue something within or public unmediated not necessitate image suggested and camera directly work behavior 1970s although aesthetic portable thereby negotiate the timing to called existence subtle photographer scale any what people with key through in changing	photography genre	genre photography	City
Street art	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Street art</b> is visual art created in public locations for public visibility. It has been associated with the terms ""independent art"", ""post-graffiti"", ""neo-graffiti"" and guerrilla art.</p><p>Street art has evolved from the early forms of defiant graffiti into a more commercial form of art, as one of the main differences now lies with the messaging. Street art is often meant to provoke thought rather than rejection among the general audience through making its purpose more evident than that of graffiti. The issue of permission has also come at the heart of street art, as graffiti is usually done illegally, whereas street art can nowadays be the product of an agreement or even sometimes a commission.

In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered by property owners and civic authorities as defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime, citing the use of graffiti by street gangs to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.

Carnival	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Carnival</b> is a Catholic festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus. Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent. Traditionally, butter, milk, and other animal products were not consumed ""excessively"", rather, their stock was fully consumed as to reduce waste. This festival is known for being a time of great indulgence before Lent (which is a time stressing the opposite), with drinking, overeating, and various other activities of indulgence being performed. For example, Pancakes, donuts, and other desserts are prepared and eaten for a final time. During Lent, animal products are eaten less, and individuals have the ability to make a Lenten sacrifice, thus giving up a certain object or activity of desire. </p><p>Other common features of Carnival include mock battles such as food fights; expressions of social satire; mockery of authorities; costumes of the grotesque body that display exaggerated features such as large noses, bellies, mouths, phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms. The Italian tradition of wearing masks dates back to the Venice Carnival in the 15th century, and has been an inspiration in Greek theater and Commedia dell'arte for centuries.</p><p>The term <i>Carnival</i> is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence, as well as in Greece. In historically Evangelical Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans (Church of England/US Episcopal Church), Methodists, and other Protestants, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras. In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. </p>"	lent commedia evangelical inspiration century early liturgical party time used object term tradition venice street are last europe indulgence large church disease other well shrovetide fight social degrading upcoming penitential open traditionally performed norm wa an include this great anglican observance presence phallus day participant exaggerated be including area st carnival for were will activity depiction that sense celebration mock episcopal ability everyday germanspeaking netherlands opposite slavic typically stressing donut pancake prelenten high individual prepared certain product protestant rule tuesday allow along consumed often food 15th such parade up experience fastelavn lenten lutheran been of thus le wearing week englandus final before greece which occurs individuality is catholic set rather mouth consumption on excessively gleeful milk fully 1111 alcohol dellarte gras eastern display feature satire event period some date am stock harvest death grotesque at march belly main festive act general unity a elaborate their animal occur abusive nation centuriesthe orthodox overeating festival element circus being reduce battle waste or public advent meat maslenitsa not example february entertainment have and various celebrated drinking make concentration historically greek dessert costume known forgone country nose heightened the butter authority methodist mockery reversal indulge to mask body desire shrove season during prelent combining common aside expression eaten giving excessive italian language people mardi ha involves with back sacrifice martin theater in	festive season which occurs immediately before Lent	lent before which occurs festive season immediately	City

Street marketing	<p><b>Street marketing</b> is a form of guerrilla marketing that uses nontraditional or unconventional methods to promote a product or service. Many businesses use fliers, coupons, posters and art displays as a cost-effective alternative to the traditional marketing methods such as television, print and social media. Based on the shifting characteristics of modern-day consumers – such as increased product knowledge and expectations of transparency – the goal of street marketing is to use direct communication to enhance brand recognition.</p><p>This style of marketing grew in popularity in 1986 when Jay Conrad Levinson published his book <i>Guerrilla Marketing</i>, which paved the future for unconventional and abnormal brand campaigns. Street marketing is often confused with ambient marketing, which is a marketing strategy of placing ads on unusual objects or in unusual places where you wouldn't usually expect to have an advertisement. Unlike typical public marketing campaigns that use billboards, street marketing involves the application of multiple techniques and practices in order to establish direct contact with the customers.

Marketplace	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p>A <b>marketplace</b> or <b>market place</b> is a location where people regularly gather for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other goods. In different parts of the world, a marketplace may be described as a <i>souk</i> (from the Arabic), <i>bazaar</i> (from the Persian), a fixed <i>mercado</i> (Spanish), or itinerant <i>tianguis</i> (Mexico), or <i>palengke</i> (Philippines). Some markets operate daily and are said to be <i>permanent</i> markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be <i>periodic markets.</i> The form that a market adopts depends on its locality's population, culture, ambient and geographic conditions. The term <i>market</i> covers many types of trading, as market squares, market halls and food halls, and their different varieties. Thus marketplaces can be both outdoors and indoors, and in the modern world, online marketplaces. </p><p>Markets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar. Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun. In Europe, informal, unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal, chartered markets from the 12th century. Throughout the medieval period, increased regulation of marketplace practices, especially weights and measures, gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices. Around the globe, markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions, especially weather, tradition, and culture. In the Middle East, markets tend to be covered, to protect traders and shoppers from the sun. In milder climates, markets are often open air. In Asia, a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in non-perishables is common. </p><p>Today, markets can also be accessed electronically or on the internet through e-commerce or matching platforms. In many countries, shopping at a local market is a standard feature of daily life. Given the market's role in ensuring food supply for a population, markets are often highly regulated by a central authority. In many places, designated market places have become listed sites of historic and architectural significance and represent part of a town's or nation's cultural assets. For these reasons, they are often popular tourist destinations. </p>"	mercado hall these bazaar human throughout nonperishables type century purchase square protect also roof by believed persia term tradition made sale become fairness significance are electronically provision consumer night europe historic trader other represent role sun where from central open part cultural can popular spanish chartered medieval increased day shopping fierce be designed quality town originated engaged location for were adopts depends many said purchaser highly documentary others gave specified that morning held confidence population while form place either local given unregulated described tianguis stall online typically ambient existed frequent culture food east regulation often such weight earliest ecommerce supply mexico they city regularly operate asset persian of thus le philippine 3000 week bce site milder covered middle regulated both is emergence today fresh architectural cover strip produce on particular souk marketplace good it modern source side way designated eastern evolved around life feature arabic creating tourist some period accessed different air rest asia standard fixed periodic market shopper at confined listed formal nation a their indoors ensuring long may once festival or trading policy gradually livestock variety have 12th depending and practice spread geographic weather tend climate system country trade the locality authority itinerant condition outdoors daily to permanent world common especially matching necessary zoning measure destination people internet palengke with reason platform suggest price through globe in gather informal	space in which a market operates	market which space a operates in	City

Hawker (trade)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>hawker</b> is a vendor of merchandise that can be easily transported; the term is roughly synonymous with costermonger or peddler.

Social commentator Henry Mayhew wrote, ""Among the more ancient of the trades, then carried on in England, is that of the hawker or pedlar"", and he notes, ""the hawker dealt, in the old times, more in textile fabrics than in anything else."" In several passages of his work, Mayhew categorises hawkers, hucksters, and peddlers as a single group of itinerant salesman, and claims that he is unable to say what distinction was drawn between a hawker and a huckster.

In London more specific terms were used, such as costermonger. </p><p>From antiquity, peddlers filled the gaps in the formal market economy by providing consumers with the convenience of door-to-door service. They operated alongside town markets and fairs where they often purchased surplus stocks which were subsequently resold to consumers. Peddlers were able to distribute goods to the more geographically isolated communities such as those who lived in mountainous regions of Europe. They also called on consumers who, for whatever reason, found it difficult to attend town markets. Thus, peddlers played an important role in linking these consumers and regions to wider trade routes. Some peddlers worked as agents or travelling salesmen for larger manufacturers, thus were the precursor to the modern travelling salesman. </p><p>Images of peddlers feature in literature and art from as early as the 12th-century. Such images were very popular with the genre and Orientalist painters and photographers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Some imagery depicts peddlers in a pejorative manner, while others portray idealised, Romantic visions of peddlers at work. </p>	manufacturer hawker these operated worked more century played early able also used by distribute idealised gap term salesman isolated pedlar consumer antiquity europe resold painter role who from where wa popular an packman lived linking andor 12thcentury hawking british town for orientalist were those very pejorative london filled others service manner english while vision surplus fair small portray alongside economy depicts mountainous chapman often route such subsequently they larger geographically of thus which doortodoor is genre literature romantic on attend good travelling it traveller region modern 19th feature some countryside providing difficult stock community agent huckster england market at cheapjack formal a convenience precursor art solicitor mostly higler found imagery or purchased image and work village whatever known wider trade peddler the important colporteur to called photographer costermonger with reason vendor specific in 18th	travelling vendor of goods	travelling vendor good of	City

Road cycling	<p><b>Road cycling</b> is the most widespread form of cycling in which cyclists ride on paved roadways. It includes recreational, racing, commuting, and utility cycling. As users of the road, road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same laws as motorists, however there are certain exceptions. While there are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads such as BMX, recumbents, racing, touring and utility bicycles, dedicated road bicycles have specific characteristics that make them ideal for the sport. Road bicycles have thinner tires, lighter frames with no suspension, and a set of drop handle bars to allow riders to get in a more aerodynamic position while cycling at higher speeds. On a flat road, an intermediate cyclist can average about 18 to 20 mph (29 to 32 km/h), while a professional rider can average up to 25 mph (40 km/h). At higher speeds, wind resistance gets stronger and the light, aerodynamic road bikes that have developed over the years ensure that most of the riders' energy is spent propelling the bike forward.</p>	higher most commuting sport 40 expected cyclist more type used ideal recreational road are motorist 32 characteristic 29 paved mph can an includes aerodynamic same over rider for drop wind many average that 25 widespread forward form while light cycling certain resistance stronger allow such them 18 up obey however exception generally of thinner year which there is handle set on lighter it bar touring about utility user law speed energy ensure at frame recumbents tire ride a no 20 flat bicycle suspension have and bmx racing make professional intermediate roadway the to position propelling kmh bike developed dedicated with get specific in spent	form of cycling including recreational, racing, and utility cycling	and utility racing form recreational of including cycling	City
Street children	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Street children</b> are poor or homeless children who live on the streets of a city, town, or village.

Street girls are sometimes called <b>gamines</b>, a term that is also used for Colombian street children of either sex.</p><p>Some street children, notably in more developed nations, are part of a subcategory called thrown-away children, consisting of children who have been forced to leave home.

Road skating	<p><b>Road skating</b> is the sport of skating (inline skating or quad roller skating) on roads, much like road cycling. It shares much with inline speed skating. </p><p>Roadskaters often skate in tight packs, drafting each other and sharing the lead, which allows a pack to travel faster than an individual skater. The individual members of a pack use comparatively less energy than the lone skater traveling at the same speed. Even the lead skater in the pack enjoys an advantage from the drafting skaters behind. </p><p>While gliding downhill, an inline skater in a tucked position can achieve speeds that exceed the speed of a tucked cyclist. This is due to lower wind resistance. The rolling resistance is similar for a cyclist and a skater — it is only when actively skating (i.e., in the skating stroke) that the skater incurs greater resistance. Skating is roughly 50% slower than cycling on flat ground. </p><p>Skaters routinely achieve downhill speeds of 60 km/h (37 mph), similar to cyclists. Compared to cyclists, though, skaters particularly suffer on uphills, when the drafting advantage disappears. </p><p>A skating paceline going down hills may easily achieve speeds faster than a cycling paceline of equal length. The reason is that the road skating paceline has a much more efficient draft effect. The draft effect in road skating is superior for three reasons: </p> <ol><li>each skater can be much closer to the person in front of her, whereas each cyclist is limited by the distance of the wheels;</li> <li>each skater gaining inertia energy from being in the draft can translate this energy to the person in front of her by maintaining contact (usually by placing a hand on the lower back of the person in front); and</li> <li>the skater has much less equipment-related aerodynamic drag than the cyclist.</li></ol>	her translate sport cyclist more like downhill by draft road tight sharing allows lone other front behind member mph from can gaining inline an aerodynamic due this ground same be superior for ie much wind efficient roadskaters when stroke hand that faster each maintaining while inertia effect routinely distance cycling individual roughly resistance often — hill though length skating closer placing even compared incurs of le three actively enjoys 60 travel which rolling lower disappears skater is achieve equipmentrelated share on it lead comparatively advantage paceline similar 37 slower speed energy usually at particularly roller a use may being uphill flat drag limited or pack 50 going contact exceed person and down gliding easily skate the whereas quad than to position tucked drafting traveling kmh equal only suffer ha back with reason wheel in greater	sport discipline	discipline sport	City

AVANT	<p><b>AVANT</b>, also known as <b>AVANT street art guerrilla collective,</b> was the artist group active in New York City from 1980 to 1984. By 1984 AVANT had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops and galleries citywide. Principal artists were Christopher Hart Chambers, David Fried, and Marc Thorne. </p><p>AVANT was a group of five young New York artists working collectively who wheat pasted handmade original poster sized works of non-calligraphic art in the streets of NYC. While the members of Avant assert that they began in the winter of 1980, the earliest available press documentation of their street art or art exhibitions is found in the New York Native from June 1982, wherein a later article published in the Villager places their origins at January 1981. By 1984 avant had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops, galleries and museums citywide, concentrated mostly in lower Manhattan. As a group, they were capable of producing hundreds of individual paintings per week, and deployed them in the streets on a regular basis. They also mounted three-dimensional artworks to street sign poles and commandeered bus stop advertising light boxes, replacing the contents with their own original works of art, then relocking the cabinets. Over 40 exhibitions of AVANT's work were held in New York galleries and nightclubs between 1981 and 1984. Over a typical artist-gallery financial dispute, they actually managed to commandeer a gallery in Soho to open the 1982 September season with a self curated exhibition. Another fresh concept was to start an exhibition in the street that would continue into a gallery. They called this the “Drive-In Show,” which started with a dozen numbered oversized paintings pasted high up on a parking lot wall in Soho, and continued up the block in Gabrielle Bryers Gallery starting with painting number 13.</p>	continued concentrated marc commandeered busstops number 40 1982 artistgallery had june between start producing would also relocking by native street mounted concept citywide group actually collectively member who from young open wall wa principal financial an “ press this gallery avant basis january wheat over cabinet dispute were per nyc curated assert that held 1981 chamber later villager another numbered bryers produced while place dozen light pole high individual lot five managed acrylic them up christopher earliest started collective they city advertising wherein of 1980 week continue oversized box parking article noncalligraphic lower which artwork poster then is pasted fresh replacing fried ” avants on own sized painting bus museum origin self gabrielle september door stop original at 1984 thorne threedimensional new a their guerrilla art mostly capable found paper into or york began block and work documentation thousand drivein known sign content nightclub the starting artist deployed to soho called plastered david winter season typical show handmade available hundred active published 13 manhattan hart with working regular in commandeer exhibition	artist group in New York in the 1980s	the 1980s group artist new york in	City

In retaliation, Protestant loyalists attacked Catholic enclaves in west Belfast, burning homes and businesses. This sparked rioting and gun battles between Protestants and Catholics, including paramilitaries. There were also gun battles between republicans/nationalists and the police, and some police patrols fired indiscriminately at Catholic civilians. Seventeen people were killed or fatally wounded on 10 July, and a further three were killed or fatally wounded before the truce began at noon on 11 July. At least 100 people were wounded.

Siege of Carthage (Third Punic War)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Siege of Carthage</b> was the main engagement of the Third Punic War fought between Carthage and Rome. It consisted of the nearly-three-year siege of the Carthaginian capital, Carthage (a little north east of Tunis). In 149 BC a large Roman army landed at Utica in North Africa. The Carthaginians hoped to appease the Romans, but despite the Carthaginians surrendering all of their weapons, the Romans pressed on to besiege the city of Carthage. The Roman campaign suffered repeated setbacks through 149 BC, only alleviated by Scipio Aemilianus, a middle-ranking officer, distinguishing himself several times. A new Roman commander took over in 148 BC, and fared equally badly. At the annual election of Roman magistrates in early 147 BC the public support for Scipio was so great that the usual age restrictions were lifted to allow him to be appointed commander in Africa. </p><p>Scipio's term commenced with two Carthaginian successes, but he tightened the siege and commenced a construction of a large mole to prevent supplies from getting into Carthage via blockade runners. The Carthaginians had partially rebuilt their fleet and it sortied, to the Romans' surprise; after an indecisive engagement the Carthaginians mismanaged their withdrawal and lost many ships. The Romans then built a large brick structure in the harbour area which dominated the city wall. In the spring of 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault and over seven days systematically destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants; only on the last day did they take prisoners – 50,000, who were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian territories became the Roman province of Africa with Utica as its capital. It was a century before the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city. </p>"	construction 50000 mole had century bc early between africa alleviated time by surprise term seven carthaginian last success large rome tunis destroyed who runner territory from tightened mismanaged wall structure spring wa an brick great he day age be roman over area built several for were many partially systematically getting capital that lifted war took commenced third besiege 146 became suffered commander nearlythreeyear support restriction scipio appointed allow take equally middleranking rebuilt east after two army 148 harbour supply they surrendering city assault via of prevent lost site final before which siege him then distinguishing repeated but officer so on pressed badly 149 dominated it sortied fleet – 147 usual ship launched fared sold campaign appease carthage at setback main new magistrate a their blockade killed indecisive all into withdrawal weapon public consisted and did slavery engagement utica hoped formerly prisoner the himself inhabitant to election despite punic only landed province little with north through fought annual in aemilianus	main engagement of the Third Punic War in which the Roman Republic besieged the Punic city of Carthage, (c. 149–146 BC)	the carthage bc war which city engagement third main c 149–146 of roman in besieged punic republic	City

Battle of Shanghai	"<p><span></span> </p> <p>The <b>Battle of Shanghai</b> (Chinese: <span lang=""zh-Hant"">淞滬會戰</span>) was the first of the twenty-two major engagements fought between the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) of the Empire of Japan at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. It lasted from August 13, 1937, to November 26, 1937, and was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war, later described as ""Stalingrad on the Yangtze"", and is often regarded as the battle where World War II started. After over three months of extensive fighting on land, in the air and at sea, the battle concluded with a victory for Japan. </p><p>Since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 followed by the Japanese attack of Shanghai in 1932, there had been ongoing armed conflicts between China and Japan without an official declaration of war. These conflicts finally escalated in July 1937, when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the full advance from Japan. Dogged Chinese resistance at Shanghai was aimed at stalling Japanese advance, giving much needed time for the Chinese government to move vital industries to the interior, while at the same time attempting to bring sympathetic Western powers to China's side. During the fierce three-month battle, Chinese and Japanese troops fought in downtown Shanghai, in the outlying towns, and on the beaches of the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay, where the Japanese had made amphibious landings. </p><p>Chinese forces were equipped with primarily with small-caliber weapons against much greater Japanese air, naval, and armor power. In the end, Shanghai fell, and China lost a significant portion of its best troops, while failing to elicit any international intervention. The resistance of Chinese forces and length of the battle at over 3 months shocked the Japanese, who had been indoctrinated with notions of cultural and martial superiority, and largely demoralized the Imperial Japanese Army who believed they could take Shanghai within days and China within months. </p><p>The battle can be divided into three stages, and eventually involved nearly one million troops. The first stage lasted from August 13 to August 22, 1937, during which the NRA attempted to eradicate Japanese troop presence in downtown Shanghai. The second stage lasted from August 23 to October 26, 1937, during which the Japanese launched amphibious landings on the Jiangsu coast and the two armies fought a Stalingrad-type house-to-house battle, with the Japanese attempting to gain control of the city and the surrounding regions. The last stage, ranging from October 27 to the end of November 1937, involved the retreat of the Chinese army in the face of Japanese flanking maneuvers, and the ensuing combat on the road to China's capital, Nanjing. </p>"	maneuver shocked july these control 1937 troop stalingrad stalingradtype yangtze attack martial had fell between 26 time naval sea by believed made full ensuing superiority invasion interior roc last road eradicate shanghai face imperial largely who regarded from where move cultural can wa without an smallcaliber 淞滬會戰 august since stalling bridge presence day same fierce beginning dogged armor over be town national for landing land were hangzhou much equipped jiangsu flanking intervention major when capital month best river involved incident war could later amphibious while million advance described ii nearly sympathetic stage resistance eventually elicit take industry demoralized twentytwo often after vital extensive two army length nanjing republic started they concluded city force been of three lost entire attempted which primarily beach there ongoing is 22 bring international on 23 conflict polo it side end portion region retreat government chinese gain failing ija official november launched manchuria bloodiest air china coast marco needed finally downtown significant at 1932 1931 combat a power divided japan sinojapanese notion declaration battle within into surrounding armed western attempting weapon indoctrinated and largest one first engagement escalated bay housetohouse second japanese the october against outlying to triggered ranging world victory during 3 giving any lasted empire 13 nra 27 fighting with revolutionary aimed followed fought in greater threemonth	1937 battle of the Second Sino-Japanese War	the war battle 1937 of second sinojapanese	City
Hungarian Revolution of 1956	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Hungarian Revolution of 1956</b> (also known as the <b>Hungarian Uprising</b>, 23 October – 10 November 1956; Hungarian: <i lang=""hu"">1956-os forradalom</i>), was a countrywide revolution against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic (1949–1989) and the Hungarian domestic policies imposed by the USSR. Initially anarchic, during the Hungarian Uprising the Hungarian people culminated in protests against domestic policies imposed by the USSR, and the people formed together in protest against the Soviet Union.</p><p>The Hungarian Revolution began on 23 October 1956 in Budapest when university students appealed to the civil populace to join them at the Hungarian Parliament Building to protest against the USSR's geopolitical domination of Hungary with the Stalinist government of Mátyás Rákosi. A delegation of students entered the building of Hungarian Radio to broadcast their sixteen demands for political and economic reforms to the civil society of Hungary, but they were instead detained by security guards. When the student protestors outside the radio building demanded the release of their delegation of students, policemen from the ÁVH (Államvédelmi Hatóság) state protection authority shot and killed several protestors.</p><p>Consequently, Hungarians organized into revolutionary militias to fight against the ÁVH; local Hungarian Communist leaders and ÁVH policemen were captured and summarily killed or lynched; and anti-communist political prisoners were released and armed. To realize their political, economic, and social demands, the local soviets (councils of workers) assumed control of municipal government from the Hungarian Working People's Party (<span title=""Hungarian-language text""><i lang=""hu"">Magyar Dolgozók Pártja</i></span>). The new government of Imre Nagy disbanded the ÁVH, declared the Hungarian withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, and pledged to re-establish free elections.

Urban warfare	"<p><b>Urban warfare</b> is combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities. Urban combat differs from combat in the open at both the operational and the tactical levels. Complicating factors in urban warfare include the presence of civilians and the complexity of the urban terrain. Urban combat operations may be conducted to capitalize on strategic or tactical advantages associated with the possession or the control of a particular urban area or to deny these advantages to the enemy.</p><p>Fighting in urban areas negates the advantages that one side may have over the other in armor, heavy artillery, or air support. Ambushes laid down by small groups of soldiers with handheld anti-tank weapons can destroy entire columns of modern armor (as in the First Battle of Grozny), while artillery and air support can be severely reduced if the ""superior"" party wants to limit civilian casualties as much as possible, but the defending party does not (or even uses civilians as human shields). </p><p>Some civilians may be difficult to distinguish from such combatants as armed militias and gangs, and particularly individuals who are simply trying to protect their homes from attackers. Tactics are complicated by a three-dimensional environment, limited fields of view and fire because of buildings, enhanced concealment and cover for defenders, below-ground infrastructure, and the ease of placement of booby traps and snipers.</p>"	these control shield human sniper concealment us party protect by reduced are ambush group other who deny from open urban can laid possible include doe presence distinguish be armor superior over area tactic town destroy for belowground limit much building militia that complicating view while because defender support small simply artillery terrain individual such severely handheld city soldier even possession complicated of warfare environment infrastructure entire ease complexity both is placement but cover on particular grozny antitank side modern advantage trying capitalize some air difficult level at combat particularly threedimensional column a their trap negates conducted may defending enhanced battle limited or weapon armed not fire have attacker and factor down one first if differs tactical booby civilian gang enemyfighting the to home casualty operation heavy with strategic operational want combatant associated in field	combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities	and city combat a such area in conducted town urban	City
1969 Northern Ireland riots	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>During 12–16 August 1969, there was an outbreak of political and sectarian violence throughout Northern Ireland, which is often seen as the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles. There had been sporadic violence throughout the year arising out of the Northern Ireland civil rights campaign, which demanded an end to discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists. Civil rights marches had been attacked by Protestant loyalists, and protesters often clashed with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), the overwhelmingly Protestant police force. </p><p>On 12 August, the Battle of the Bogside erupted in Derry: three days of fierce clashes between the RUC and thousands of Catholic/nationalist residents of the Bogside district. The besieged residents built barricades and set up first aid posts and workshops for making petrol bombs. Police fired CS gas at rioters for the first time in the history of the UK. In support of the Bogsiders, on 13 August Catholics/nationalists held protests elsewhere in Northern Ireland, some of which led to violence. The bloodiest clashes were in Belfast, where seven people were killed and hundreds wounded, five of them Catholic civilians shot by police. Protesters clashed with both the police and with loyalists, who attacked Catholic districts. Scores of homes and businesses were burnt out, most of them owned by Catholics, and thousands of mostly Catholic families were driven from their homes. In some cases, police helped the loyalists and failed to protect Catholic areas. Some viewed this as an attempted pogrom against the Catholic minority. Both republican and loyalist paramilitaries were involved in the clashes. There were also clashes between protesters and police in Armagh, where a protester was killed by police, as well as in Dungannon and Newry. </p><p>The British Army was deployed to restore order on 14 August, beginning the thirty-seven year Operation Banner, and peace lines were built to separate Catholic and Protestant districts. The Republic of Ireland's government set up field hospitals and refugee centres near the Irish border, and called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be sent to Northern Ireland. The British government held an inquiry into the riots, and the reserve police force was disbanded. The riots led to the formation of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Official Irish Republican Army. It also led to the growth of loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). </p>"	protester case family throughout order most banner had reserve between driven time protect history also by northern discrimination seven riot demanded ulster workshop civil district well who where wounded from outbreak minority right wa an barricade pogrom border august this provisional day fierce beginning be british area built for were violence royal held involved aid belfast near support ruc protestant derry disbanded five often such sporadic them army up republic volunteer resident seen force uvf bomb business been year uk of hospital three c bogside led attacked attempted which centre post there erupted petrol both dungannon peacekeeping is catholicsnationalists clashed catholic set 14 separate on bogsiders it growth political end fired armagh government thirtyseven irish line official some out catholicnationalist bloodiest viewed campaign paramilitary 12 constabulary at march refugee formation 1969 loyalist score shot nation a protest their killed burnt mostly battle into owned 12–16 and first inquiry thousand sectarian civilian known overwhelmingly sent newry united the police republican against deployed to restore peace called gas during nationalist home clash arising besieged failed hundred operation 13 people rioter trouble making ireland with elsewhere thirtyyear helped conflict in field	series of political and sectarian riots, August 1969	and august 1969 sectarian political of riot series	City

At the time, the South Korean government reported estimates of around 170 people killed, but other estimates have measured 600 to 2,300 people killed. During Chun Doo-hwan's unelected presidency, the authorities defined the incident by classifying it as the ''Gwangju Riot,'' and claimed that it was being instigated by ""communist sympathizers and rioters"", possibly acting on support of the North Korean government.</p><p>Denial of or support for the Gwangju Uprising has long acted as a litmus test between conservative and far-right groups and beliefs, and mainstream and progressive sectors of the population, within modern Korean politics. The far-right groups have sought to discredit the uprising. One such argument points to the fact that it occurred before Chun Doo-hwan officially took office, and so contend that it could not really have been a simple student protest against him that started it. However, Chun Doo-hwan had become the de facto leader of South Korea at that time since coming into power on December 12, 1979, after leading a successful military coup against the previous South Korean government which was itself also authoritarian.</p><p>In 1997, a national cemetery and day of commemoration (May 18), along with acts to ""compensate, and restore honor"" to victims, were established. Later investigations would confirm various atrocities which had been committed by the army. In 2011, 1980 Archives for the May 18th Democratic Uprising against Military Regime located in Gwangju's city hall were inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. </p>"	december authoritarianin 1979 control hall sometimes troop leader successful classifying martial 五一八光州民主化運動 had located would between able also time victim by office regime 600 facto inscribed become 光州民主化抗爭 communist riot presidency itself large conservative university group fact gwangjus other cemetery occurred who movement arm from 운동 unesco massacre popular wa upon since point leading day oilpal struggle national honor for were student acting acted reported simple 2300 민주화 that test 오일팔 incident population doohwan could 1997 took later mainstream put local reentered 광주 litmus korea democratic support armoury coming take previous along doohwans after raiding chonnam such army 18 up estimate unelected started however city 항쟁 chun soldier pitted hanja been of section 1980 gwangju officially before which him is coup korean but sector so on governmentdenial contend south commemoration it modern fired really government belief around discredit uprising station demonstrating event some 2011 progressive 五一八 date instigated law 12 at argument claimed politics act confirm a 170 protest power killed long may being rr measured within or armed into not began have reference and down compensate various one established investigation defined known register the police authority against de to restore called democratization archive world during 5·18 farright committed sought citizen people rioter ha memory 27 possibly with military sympathizer raped north beaten in 18th atrocity	1980 social movement in South Korea	south social movement korea 1980 in	City

On the night of 24 August, elements of General Philippe Leclerc's 2nd French Armored Division made their way into Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville shortly before midnight. The next morning, 25 August, the bulk of the 2nd Armored Division and US 4th Infantry Division and other allied units entered the city.

The operation took place from August to October 1993 and was supervised by the United States' Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). </p><p>As part of the operation, troops were deployed on a coalition mission to arrest two of Aidid's lieutenants.

The battle of Mogadishu remains one of the most devastating defeats experienced in close combat by American troops.

First Red Scare	<p>The <b>First Red Scare</b> was a period during the early 20th-century history of the United States marked by a widespread fear of far-left extremism, including but not limited to Bolshevism and anarchism, due to real and imagined events; real events included the Russian 1917 October Revolution and anarchist bombings. At its height in 1919–1920, concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in American society and the alleged spread of communism and anarchism in the American labor movement fueled a general sense of concern. </p><p>The Scare had its origins in the hyper-nationalism of World War I as well as the Russian Revolution. At the war's end, following the October Revolution, American authorities saw the threat of communist revolution in the actions of organized labor, including such disparate cases as the Seattle General Strike and the Boston Police Strike and then in the bombing campaign directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders. Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings, and then spurred on by the Palmer Raids and attempts by United States Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to suppress radical organizations, it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric, illegal search and seizures, unwarranted arrests and detentions, and the deportation of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists. In addition, the growing anti-immigration nativist movement among Americans viewed increasing immigration from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe as a threat to American political and social stability. </p><p>Bolshevism and the threat of a communist-inspired revolution in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the social order, even for such largely unrelated events as incidents of interracial violence during the Red Summer of 1919. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in the form of display of certain flags and banners. In April 1920, concerns peaked with J. Edgar Hoover telling the nation to prepare for a bloody uprising on May Day. Police and militias prepared for the worst, but May Day passed without incident. Soon, public opinion and the courts turned against Palmer, putting an end to his raids and the First Red Scare. </p>	case i stability american order leader seizure 1920 banner had fueled early threat real history used by suppress society communist suspected europe group freedom raid increasing well largely attorney movement social from russian detention wa illegal without an deportation due turned immigration day exaggerated suppression including over radicalism several organized for boston violence militia 1919–1920 search spurred following 20thcentury incident war sense widespread j bloody form unwarranted among opinion effect directed flag revolution concern certain prepared nativist alleged farleft bombing such court unrest seattle mitchell business characterized even explain of action telling southern anarchism 1917 explanation rhetoric then peaked addition but red included height on april anarchist it political end saw origin eastern organization display his uprising event bolshevism period prepare passed scare viewed campaign arrest labor overriding state extremism at u growing hoover general nation a antiimmigration disparate worst may marked summer limited public radical not agitation palmer attempt and first fear spread hypernationalism putting interracial communism united the authority imagined october police strike unrelated against to world during edgar soon expression challenge hundred communistinspired 1919 with became in	early 20th-century American historical event	early event american historical 20thcentury	City

Prague uprising	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Prague uprising</b> (Czech: <i lang=""cs"">Pražské povstání</i>) was a partially successful attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation in May 1945, at the end of World War II. The preceding six years of occupation had fuelled anti-German sentiment and the approach of the Soviet Red Army and the US Third Army offered a chance of success. </p><p>On 5 May 1945, in the last moments of the war in Europe, Czech citizens spontaneously attacked the German occupiers and Czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join the uprising. The Russian Liberation Army, which had been fighting for the Germans, defected and supported the Czechs. German troops counter-attacked, but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by the Czech citizenry. On 8 May, the Czech and German leaders signed a ceasefire allowing the German forces to withdraw from the city, but not all Waffen-SS units obeyed. Fighting continued until 9 May, when the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city. </p><p>The uprising was brutal, with both sides committing war crimes. The German side used Czech civilians as human shields and committed massacres. Violence against German civilians, sanctioned by the Czechoslovak government, continued after the liberation, and was justified as revenge for the occupation or as a means to encourage Germans to flee. George Patton’s US Third Army was ordered by General Dwight Eisenhower not to come to the aid of the Czech insurgents, which undermined the credibility of the Western powers in postwar Czechoslovakia. Instead, the uprising was presented as a symbol of Czech resistance to Nazi rule, and the liberation by the Red Army was used by the Czechoslovak Communist Party to increase popular support for the party. </p>"	continued shield human troop czechoslovakia credibility leader successful presented had party used by occupation communist revenge last crime success europe czech 8 emerged instead unit moment from russian massacre wa popular barricade approach spontaneously waffenss povstání chance for violence partially allowing slowed when 5 aid war eisenhower third increase ii s nearly support german progress resistance rule encourage after army until undermined occupier city force been year of constructed 1945 six attacked which withdraw both liberated but pražské nazi red on brutal insurgent signed sentiment justified side end patton government prague uprising flee dwight citizenry obeyed entered liberation czechoslovak at u ’ supported general a soviet their power join may mean all or western defected ceasefire not attempt and fuelled 9 civilian symbol the come against to counterattacked committing world antigerman hiding sanctioned ordered committed liberate citizen preceding postwar fighting with offered george in	uprising attempting to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation during World War II	the war prague uprising city to world occupation attempting during from ii of liberate german	City

Together with the battles of Tampere and Vyborg, it was one of the three major urban battles of the Finnish Civil War. The Germans invaded Helsinki despite the opposition of Finnish White Army leader Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim who wanted to attack the capital city with his own troops after Tampere had fallen on 6 April. However, the Germans had their own interest in taking Helsinki as quickly as possible and then moving further east towards the Russian border. The city had been under Red control for 11 weeks since the beginning of the war. </p><p>The German Baltic Sea Division landed in Finland on 3 April and entered the Helsinki area eight days later. In the city centre, the defending Reds did not have defensive lines or barricades but were fighting inside single buildings and blocks, which the Germans then had to take one by one. During the battle, life in Helsinki went on as usual. The shops and restaurants were open, the public transportation functioned and factories were running. Curious spectators were wandering so close that the Germans had to tell them to move back. The White supporters considered the Germans liberators and handed them flowers as well as tea, coffee and snacks to eat. </p><p>Nearly 500 people were killed in the battle. The number includes about 400 Red Guard fighters who were killed in action or executed after capitulation, 54 Germans and 23 White Guard members.

Battle of Stalingrad	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Battle of Stalingrad</b> (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943) was a major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II where Nazi Germany and its allies unsuccessfully fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (later renamed to Volgograd) in Southern Russia. The battle was marked by fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, with the battle being the epitome of urban warfare. The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle to take place during the Second World War and is one of the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare, with an estimated 2 million total casualties. Today, the Battle of Stalingrad is universally regarded as the turning point in the European Theatre of war, as it forced the <i>Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</i> (German High Command) to withdraw considerable military forces from other areas in occupied Europe to replace German losses on the Eastern Front. The victory at Stalingrad energized the Red Army and shifted the balance of power in the favour of the Soviets. </p><p>Stalingrad was strategically important to both sides as a major industrial and transport hub on the Volga River. Whoever controlled Stalingrad would have access to the oil fields of the Caucasus; and control of the Volga. Germany, already operating on dwindling fuel supplies focused its efforts on moving deeper into Soviet territory and taking the oil fields at any cost. On 4 August, the Germans launched an offensive by using the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intense <i>Luftwaffe</i> bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The battle degenerated into house-to-house fighting as both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November, the Germans, at great cost, had pushed the Soviet defenders back into narrow zones along the west bank of the river. </p><p>On 19 November, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian armies protecting the 6th Army's flanks. The Axis flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area. Adolf Hitler was determined to hold the city at all costs and forbade the 6th Army from attempting a breakout; instead, attempts were made to supply it by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. The Soviets were successful in denying the Germans the ability to resupply through the air which strained the German forces to their breaking point. Nevertheless the German forces were determined to continue their advance and heavy fighting continued for another two months. On 2 February 1943, the German 6th army, having exhausted their ammunition and food, finally capitulated, making it the first of Hitler's field armies to surrender during World War II, after five months, one week, and three days of fighting. </p>"	continued control luftwaffe 1943 stalingrad successful replace renamed attack had would twopronged history by pushed midnovember made poured reduced narrow controlled caucasus 19 europe offensive epitome considerable raid estimated front other instead territory regarded where from adolf ammunition surrender urban wa hub protecting an unsuccessfully august great union loss point day industrial fierce axis area hold resupply for were operating much major overrun month off that river direct deadliest russia war later another million place shifted ability defender breaking advance ii cut german intense occupied high take along five turning strained food after bombing two army zone der supply city assault force dwindling of warfare nevertheless three continue week southern exhausted 1942 withdraw which both access capitulated is today theatre already total germany focused nazi breakout west red on 23 oberkommando effort favour denying cost romanian it side outside eastern break – having deeper launched november bloodiest air surrounded encirclement 4 finally european bank volgograd at 6th panzer determined combat supported a soviet power taking their whoever ally wehrmacht 4th marked being universally using element battle all into attempting hitler targeting february uranus rubble have attempt forbade and balance one first 2 fuel strategically civilian oil housetohouse second reinforcement the important degenerated energized to moving weaker world victory during flank casualty any forced command operation heavy making back with fighting military volga through fought in field closequarters transport	major battle of World War II	war battle world major ii of	City

Harley Quinn	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Harley Quinn</b> is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Quinn was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm as a comic relief henchwoman for the supervillain Joker in <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, and debuted in its 22nd episode, ""Joker's Favor"", on September 11, 1992. While originally intended to appear in one episode, Quinn became a recurring character within the DC Animated Universe as the Joker's sidekick and love interest, and was adapted into DC Comics' Batman comic book canon seven years later, beginning with the one-shot <i>Batman: Harley Quinn</i> #1 (October 1999). Quinn's origin story features her as a former psychiatrist at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum named <b>Dr. Harleen Quinzel</b> who fell in love with the Joker, her patient, eventually becoming his accomplice and lover. The character's alias is a play on the stock character Harlequin from the 16th-century theater <span title=""Italian-language text""><i lang=""it"">commedia dell'arte</i></span>. </p><p>Following her introduction to the DC Universe in 1999, Harley Quinn was depicted as a frequent accomplice and lover of the Joker as well as the best friend of fellow supervillain Poison Ivy. Later stories depicted Quinn as a supervillain who has left her abusive and codependent relationship with the Joker behind, beginning with the publication of her first ongoing series written by Karl Kesel in 2000. After years of scarce appearances in comics, Quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the <i>Gotham City Sirens</i> series, as part of an unstable alliance with Poison Ivy and Catwoman. In 2011, DC's line-wide reboot <i>The New 52</i> reintroduced Quinn in the relaunched <i>Suicide Squad</i> title, which changed the character's personality, design, and origin, replacing her original jester costume with a revealing ensemble and depicting her to be darker than her earlier counterpart. The character took a lighthearted and humorous direction with her second ongoing series in 2013, written by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti, which features the character moving to her hometown of Brooklyn and starting her own life in Coney Island. The character has since been depicted as an antihero independent of the Joker and a recurring core member of the Suicide Squad, with Poison Ivy becoming her primary romantic interest. In 2021, DC's line-wide <i>Infinite Frontier</i> relaunch brought Quinn back to Gotham City and reestablished her as a superhero seeking redemption for her past actions, with a new design combining her early and modern appearances. </p><p>Harley Quinn's abilities include expert gymnastic skills, proficiency in weapons and hand-to-hand combat, complete unpredictability, immunity to toxins, and enhanced strength, agility, and durability. Quinn often wields clown-themed gag weapons, with an oversized mallet being her signature weapon. The character has a pair of pet hyenas, Bud and Lou, which sometimes serve as her attack dogs. As a trained psychiatrist with a genius-level intellect, she is adept at deception and psychological manipulation. </p><p>Harley Quinn has become one of DC Comics' most popular and profitable characters, and has been featured in many of DC's comic books and adapted in various other media and merchandise. DC Comics Publisher Jim Lee considers Harley Quinn the fourth pillar of DC Comics' publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. </p><p>Originally voiced by Arleen Sorkin in the DC Animated Universe, she has since appeared in many other DC projects voiced by actresses such as Tara Strong, Hynden Walch, Laura Bailey, Jenny Slate, Melissa Rauch, Laura Post, and Kaley Cuoco; the latter provided the character's voice in the 2019 animated series, <i>Harley Quinn</i>.

The character was originally created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero Batman. The character's first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in <i>Detective Comics</i> #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles. Robin's early adventures included <i>Star Spangled Comics</i> #65–130 (1947–1952), the character's first solo feature. He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s, until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing. As a team, Batman and Robin have commonly been referred to as the <i>Caped Crusaders</i> and the <i>Dynamic Duo</i>.</p><p>The character's second incarnation, Jason Todd, first appeared in <i>Batman</i> #357 (1983). He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books until 1988, when he was murdered by the Joker in the storyline ""A Death in the Family"" (1989). Jason later found himself alive after a reality-changing incident, eventually becoming the Red Hood. The premiere <i>Robin</i> limited series was published in 1991, featuring the character's third incarnation, Tim Drake, training to earn the role of Batman's vigilante partner. After two successful sequels, the monthly <i>Robin</i> series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right. In 2004 storylines, established DC Comics character Stephanie Brown became the fourth Robin for a short time before the role reverted to Tim Drake. Damian Wayne succeeds Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc ""Battle for the Cowl."" </p><p>The current and former Robins always feature prominently in Batman's cast of supporting heroes; Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian all regard him as a father. In current continuity as of 2021, Dick Grayson serves as Nightwing, Jason Todd is the Red Hood, Stephanie Brown is Batgirl, and Tim Drake has picked up the mantle of Robin again after a stint as Red Robin. Damian has left behind the title Robin, but remains the title character of the <i>Robin</i> comic book.

He is the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul, and thus the grandson of Batman villain Ra's al Ghul and the potential inheritor of Wayne Enterprises. With the al Ghuls citing Bruce Wayne as the optimal successor to their empire, after faking a miscarriage to his father and calling off their marriage, Talia has kept his existence hidden from Batman until <i>Batman</i> #656 (2006). In turn, the character is revealed to have originally been intended to ""kill and replace his famous father,"" as well as serving as a host body for Ra's al Ghul, thus, in theory, unifying both Wayne and Demon factions as intended by the al Ghuls. A prototype of the character originally appeared as an unnamed infant in the 1987 story <i>Batman: Son of the Demon</i>, which at that time was not considered canon. Following this, various alternate universe stories dealt with the character's life, giving him various names.

As Garth was born with purple eyes, an anomaly signifying an evil lineage, he was cast out despite his royal status. He survives and eventually meets Aquaman whom takes in the boy as a adopted son and protégé. After acting as a member of the Teen Titans, Garth eventually abandons the Aqualad role and adopts the Tempest alias, having bolstered his newfound magical abilities with training. He would act as one of Aquaman's most trusted allies and fulfilled numerous roles in Atlantis, including being an ambassador, prince, and once succeeded his mentor as ruler of Atlantis. </p><p>In more recent continuities, the character shares a similar history although the Idyllist people are instead Atlanteans with powers to see the previous history of Atlantis, in which said ability manifests with purple eyes and is misconstrued as a sign of dark magic. Raised by his mother and later Aquaman, Garth's magical abilities were fostered through a prestigious guild in Atlantis that instructs magic though Garth left the guild after mystic accident. Gath would then act as both a soldier in Atlantis and a superhero on the surface, notably as a member of the Teen Titans and Titans, and remains as Aquaman's ally. He would eventually meet his successor, Jackson Hyde, and granted him the Aqualad moniker. </p><p>Garth would make several appearances as both Aqualad and Tempest in various media.

Etta Candy	"<p><b>Etta Candy</b> is a fictional character appearing in DC Comics publications and related media, commonly as the best friend of the superhero Wonder Woman. Spirited and vivacious, with a devil-may-care attitude, the first version of Etta appeared as a young white woman with red hair in <i>Sensation Comics</i> #2 (1942), written by Wonder Woman's creator William Moulton Marston.</p><p>Enrolled in the fictional Holliday College for Women (and often accompanied by her fellow students, ""the Holliday Girls""), Etta would become a constant feature of Wonder Woman's Golden Age adventures, effectively functioning as both the hero's plucky sidekick and her best friend. Unapologetically proud of her plus-sized figure (and vocal about her love of sweets), ""Etta's appearance was a stark contrast to the svelte, wasp-waisted women depicted in most comic books, and Etta was a brave and heroic leader who was always in the thick of the fight beside her friend Wonder Woman."" Though appearing less frequently in the Silver and Bronze Age, Etta was a recurring presence in Wonder Woman's supporting cast throughout both periods. She would be re-imagined in March 1987 by comics writer/artist George Pérez as part of his post-Crisis relaunch of the Wonder Woman mythos. This milder-mannered version, a former U.S. Air Force captain and intelligence officer, is not presented as Wonder Woman's best friend, but rather as a genial ally among a cast of supporting characters.</p><p>In 2011, Etta was again updated as part of DC Comics' company-wide New 52 continuity reboot. Still an American intelligence specialist, the modern Etta Candy is a Black woman, whose revised history with Wonder Woman restores several Golden Age elements, notably her wise-cracking joie de vivre and her status as the hero's ever-present best friend. Additionally, the New 52 Etta is queer, shown to have a romantic relationship with Barbara Ann Minerva, the British archeologist who would become Wonder Woman's arch-foe the Cheetah. Etta's brassy queerness brings to the surface a consistent lesbian subtext present in William Moulton Marston's original Golden Age characterization of a woman joyously defiant of sex-gender norms. </p><p>Beatrice Colen portrayed Etta in the 1970s <i>Wonder Woman</i> series. The character made her cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe in the 2017 film <i>Wonder Woman</i>, played by Lucy Davis. She has been portrayed in animated film by voice actors Julianne Grossman and Adrienne C.

Kid Flash	<p><b>Kid Flash</b> is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, originally created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, as a junior counterpart to DC Comics superhero The Flash. The first version of the character, <b>Wally West</b>, debuted in <i>The Flash</i> #110 (1959). The character, along with others like the first Wonder Girl, Aqualad, and Speedy, was created in response to the success of Batman's young sidekick Robin. These young heroes would later be spun off into their own superhero team, the Teen Titans. As Kid Flash, Wally West made regular appearances in Flash related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1959 through the mid-1980s until the character was reinvented as the new version of The Flash. </p><p>Later, well after Wally West had made a name for himself as the new Flash, the character of <b>Bart Allen</b>, grandson of the second Flash Barry Allen, was brought into the past from his home in the future and served as the young hero Impulse. In 2003, with writer Geoff Johns' relaunch of a new <i>Young justice</i> volume, Bart donned the mantle of Kid Flash after being nearly killed by the assassin Deathstroke. As Kid Flash, Bart appeared in <i>Teen Titans</i> and <i>The Flash</i> (vol. 2) regularly until the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> event, where a disappearance of Wally West made Bart the fourth Flash. Apparently killed by the Rogues, Bart was resurrected in the 31st century by Legion of Super-Heroes member Brainiac 5 and retook the mantle of Kid Flash. Following a 2011 reboot, DC introduced a new interpretation of Wally West as its latest Kid Flash in 2014, who was later established as being the original Wally's younger cousin <b>Wallace West</b>. </p><p>The Wally West Kid Flash was first adapted for live action in the Arrowverse family of TV shows, played by Keiynan Lonsdale.

When Peanuts made its debut on October 2, 1950, Shermy sat with another early character, Patty on the curb, and spoke the first lines of dialogue, ending with ""Good ol' Charlie Brown...How I hate him!"" which is ironic, considering how he became one of Charlie Brown's closest friends, along with Linus van Pelt and Schroeder. </p><p>Shermy famously played a shepherd in the holiday television special, A Charlie Brown Christmas.</p><p>As Peanuts matured, however, Shermy became an extraneous character who was used less and less frequently, until his final appearance in 1969.

Bart also appears in the series <i>Young Justice</i> and <i>Teen Titans</i> as a member of both superhero teams. In addition to the Teen Titans and Young Justice, Bart was a core character in 10 issues of <i>Justice League of America</i> under the mantle of the Flash. </p><p>As first conceived by writers, Bart was born in the 30th century to Meloni Thawne and Don Allen, and is part of a complex family tree of superheroes and supervillains. His father, Don, is one of the Tornado Twins and his paternal grandfather is Barry Allen, the second Flash. His paternal grandmother, Iris West Allen, is also the adoptive aunt of the third Flash, Wally West (Bart's first cousin once removed). Additionally, Bart is the first cousin of XS, a Legionnaire and daughter of Dawn Allen. On his mother's side, he is a descendant of supervillains Professor Zoom and Cobalt Blue as well as the half-brother of Owen Mercer, the second Captain Boomerang. In addition to these relatives, he had a supervillain clone known as Inertia. </p><p>For most of his superhero career, Bart was the teenage sidekick to the Wally West version of the Flash. After West's apparent death in the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> crossover event in 2006, Allen grew up and became the Flash. His tenure as the Flash was brief and concluded with his death in issue 13 of <i>The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive</i>. Allen was subsequently absent for nearly two years after his apparent death, but resurfaced—young again—as Kid Flash, in 2009's <i>Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds</i>. During DC's The New 52 era, Bart Allen was reintroduced in <i>Teen Titans</i> as the alias of an amnesiac revolutionary from the future named Bar Torr; the character was later written out of comics, and his tenure erased from continuity by subsequent DC Rebirth initiative.

Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent with a troubled past and a violent demeanor, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentor. </p><p>Though initially popular, the character as written by Jim Starlin was not well received by fans following the revamping of his origin by Max Allan Collins in <i>Batman</i> #408–409. This led to DC Comics holding a telephone poll in 1988's ""A Death in the Family"" storyline to determine whether or not the character would die at the hands of Batman's nemesis, the Joker. The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. Subsequent stories dealt with Batman's guilt over failing to save him. Todd is resurrected in 2005's ""Under the Hood"" story arc and becomes a murderous antihero known as the <b>Red Hood</b>. This transition is retained after the <i>Final Crisis</i> storyline. </p><p>The character has made appearances in several forms of media outside of comics, including television series and video games.

Following the events of <i>Batman: Battle for the Cowl</i> in 2009, Drake adopted the identity of <b>Red Robin</b>. In 2019, Tim returned to his original Robin persona, and had a brief stint in which he used the mononym ""Drake"". </p><p>As a young boy, Tim was in the audience the night Dick Grayson's parents were murdered and later managed to discover the identities of Batman and the original Robin through their exploits. After the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and witnessing Batman spiral into darkness, Tim attempted to convince Dick to resume the role of Robin, stating that ""Batman needs a Robin"". However, Dick refused to return to being Batman's sidekick, and instead Tim was appointed as the third Robin. Neal Adams redesigned the entire <i>Robin</i> costume specifically for Tim Drake's character, with the sole exception of the redesigned ""R"" logo by the late Norm Breyfogle. </p><p>Subsequent stories emphasize Tim's superior detective skills compared to the previous two Robins, which make him more similar to Batman. He succeeded Dick as the leader of the Teen Titans, and later led his own superhero team, Young Justice. He was briefly followed in the role of Robin by Stephanie Brown, and later for a longer period by Batman's biological son, Damian Wayne, during the time Tim operated as Red Robin. Tim has been shown to have a close friendships with Superboy (Conner Kent). He has had romantic relationships with Stephanie Brown and Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark). </p><p>In 2011, Tim Drake was ranked 32nd in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes. The character has been featured in various adaptations, including several animated television series set in the DCAU beginning with <i>The New Batman Adventures</i> (1997-99) and also in <i>Young Justice</i> (2010-present), and the video game series <i>Batman: Arkham</i>.

Pullman Strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Pullman Strike</b> was two interrelated strikes in 1894 that shaped national labor policy in the United States during a period of deep economic depression. First came a strike by the American Railway Union (ARU) against the Pullman factory in Chicago in spring 1894. When it failed the ARU launched a national boycott against all trains that carried Pullman passenger cars. The nationwide railroad boycott that lasted from May 11 to July 20, 1894, was a turning point for US labor law. It pitted the American Railway Union (ARU) against the Pullman Company, the main railroads, the main labor unions, and the federal government of the United States under President Grover Cleveland. The strike and boycott shut down much of the nation's freight and passenger traffic west of Detroit, Michigan. The conflict began in Chicago, on May 11 when nearly 4,000 factory employees of the Pullman Company began a wildcat strike in response to recent reductions in wages. Most of the factory workers who built Pullman cars lived in the ""company town"" of Pullman just outside of Chicago. It was designed as a model community by its namesake founder and owner George Pullman.</p><p>As the Panic of 1893 shut down much of the economy, railroads stopped purchase of new passenger cars from Pullman. When his company laid off workers and lowered wages, it did not reduce rents, and the workers called for a strike. Among the reasons for the strike were the absence of democracy within the town of Pullman and its politics, the rigid paternalistic control of the workers by the company, excessive water and gas rates, and a refusal by the company to allow workers to buy and own houses. They had not yet formed a union. Founded in 1893 by Eugene V. Debs, the ARU was an organization of railroad workers. Debs brought in ARU organizers to Pullman and signed up many of the disgruntled factory workers. When the Pullman Company refused recognition of the ARU or any negotiations, ARU called a strike against the factory, but it showed no sign of success. To win the strike, Debs decided to stop the movement of Pullman cars on railroads. The over-the-rail Pullman employees (such as conductors and porters) did not go on strike.</p><p>Debs and the ARU called a massive boycott against all trains that carried a Pullman car. It affected most rail lines west of Detroit and at its peak involved some 250,000 workers in 27 states. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) opposed the boycott because the ARU was trying to take its membership. The high prestige railroad brotherhoods of Conductors and Engineers were opposed to the boycott. The Fireman brotherhood—of which Debs had been a prominent leader—was split. The General Managers' Association of the railroads coordinated the opposition. </p><p>Thirty people were killed in riots in Chicago alone. Historian David Ray Papke, building on the work of Almont Lindsey published in 1942, estimated another 40 were killed in other states. Property damage exceeded $80 million.</p><p>The federal government obtained an injunction against the union, Debs, and other boycott leaders, ordering them to stop interfering with trains that carried mail cars. After the strikers refused, President Grover Cleveland ordered in the Army to stop the strikers from obstructing the trains. Violence broke out in many cities, and the strike collapsed. Defended by a team including Clarence Darrow, Debs was convicted of violating a court order and sentenced to prison; the ARU then dissolved. </p>"	interrelated federation july v control disgruntled 80 american order most house leader darrow michigan 40 obstructing had defended train porter purchase by democracy violating paternalistic federal decided nationwide riot success violence estimated other who movement from go freight spring wa laid an eugene lived union point engineer prison lindsey designed including factory town national built employee for obtained formed were rail much millionthe many building papke economic recent wage split carried company when sentenced rigid off that water involved prominent another refused yet namesake car because dissolved among nearly association injunction organizer strikedebs response high economy absence opposition massive allow take 1894 turning after coordinated such two boycott them up army court president they city pitted been ordering of just aru fireman chicago pullmanas detroit which 1942 traffic founded then exceeded lowered rent but west on own came 250000 signed affected deb damage negotiation shut it outside government line organization trying his brotherhood launched striker period some property shaped out brotherhood—of prestige law overtherail wildcat community conductor leader—was labor historian state stop at u manager 11 convicted main politics new under nation a owner no deep general killed broke peak may 1893 mail 4000 all 20 reduce within buy policy or pullman not clarence began win showed opposed almont and down did interfering first thirty work grover panic stopped reduction sign alone founder united the rate railway brought afl strike against membership to worker called gas team david during ray ordered railroad failed refusal any lasted excessive published cleveland people collapsed 27 with reason recognition model depression george conflict in passenger	1894 nationwide railroad strike in the United States	the in state strike 1894 nationwide railroad united	Companies

1913 Studebaker strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>1913 Studebaker strike</b> was a labor strike involving workers for the American car manufacturer Studebaker in Detroit. The six-day June 1913 strike, organized by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), is considered the first major labor strike in the automotive industry. </p><p>Early in the year, the IWW, a radical anti-capitalist labor union, began to actively organize Detroit autoworkers, who had become a center of the automotive industry. IWW organizers including Matilda Robbins and James H. Walsh initially attempted to organize at the Ford Motor Company, but following fierce opposition they shifted their focus to Studebaker. The company had recently shifted its pay schedule from weekly to once every two weeks, which was very unpopular with the workers. Tensions escalated even more when a vocal critic of the two-week pay schedule was fired, and about 3,500 workers went on strike on June 17. In the following days this number grew to about 6,000 Studebaker employees and their demands included a weekly pay schedule, improved working conditions and an eight-hour day. By June 19, workers attempted to spread the strike to other car manufacturers, which led to a violent confrontation with police outside of the Packard manufacturing plant and a subsequent city ban on large marches and parades. While the strikers continued to make their demands public and attempted to generate support, Studebaker began hiring strikebreakers. Facing this, the strikers voted to end the strike on June 23. </p><p>During the strike, Studebaker instituted a policy where employees could receive up to 70 percent of their pay halfway through the two-week period, which placated many of the employees. The IWW maintained a presence in the city and planned to target Ford the following year. This, among other reasons, contributed to Ford announcing a $5 daily pay for its workers at a time when the industry average pay was about half of that. The strike was one of several that ended in failure for the IWW in 1913, and the union continued to face both internal and external issues through the following years. In Detroit, organized labor would not gain a stable and sizeable foothold until the 1930s. </p>"	continued manufacturer stable ended h american number pay more 70 had june early would time by organize become 17 19 large instituted other subsequent face who from where tension involving wa motor an hiring packard this union placated presence day industrial failure fierce including several employee for organized many very major company when average following 6000 that studebaker 5 target could 3500 while demand car shifted improved plant among support 1930s organizer james 1913 opposition industry two parade up half until automotive schedule they city foothold even percent iww year of twoweek actively week led vocal attempted detroit which voted maintained both confrontation is critic but autoworkers on included 23 external facing halfway weekly it end fired outside went violent focus internal gain eighthour about striker unpopular period labor at march sixday announcing generate a their manufacturing ban contributed considered grew once issue policy public walsh radical every sizeable not planned began center and receive one first spread make robbins escalated the police condition strikebreaker strike matilda daily to worker world ford during anticapitalist initially with reason recently working through in	1919 labor strike in Detroit, US	labor detroit strike u 1919 in	Companies
1979 Boston University strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>1979 Boston University strike</b> was a labor strike involving employees at Boston University, a private university in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The strike, involving faculty members, clerical workers, and librarians, began on April 5 and was fully ended by April 23. </p><p>The strike has its background in the presidency of John Silber, who became president of the university in 1971. Over the next few years, Silber made many changes that proved unpopular with the university's faculty, and in 1975, the university's chapter of the American Association of University Professors (BU-AAUP) voted to act as a collective bargaining unit. Silber initially challenged the legality of the union, but by 1978, a court ruling mandated that the university had to commence negotiations with the union. Over the next few months, neither side came to a solid agreement, with pay increases being a particular point of contention. </p><p>In early 1979, the union began preparing for strike action, and on April 5, following a disagreement over a tentative agreement that had previously been reached, the union went on strike. That same day, clerical workers and librarians (unionized under the Distributive Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union, respectively) also voted to go on strike, partially in an act of solidarity with the AAUP and partially as a way to receive union recognition. The strike resulted in the cancellation of several hundred classes and particularly affected the College of Liberal Arts. On April 14, the faculty voted to end the strike after the university agreed to the previous tentative agreement, with the provision that they not perform any sort of sympathy strike with other unions. The clerical workers and librarians remained on strike for several more days despite this, and some professors tried to hold classes on locations away from the university as a show of solidarity with the strikers. They finally ended their strike on April 23 after the university agreed to recognize the two unions. </p><p>A year after the strike, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that faculty at private universities were not protected to unionize under the terms of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, and as a result, when the BU-AAUP's contract expired in 1982, the union became decertified. For this reason, historian Gary Zabel calls the strike a Pyrrhic victory for the faculty. </p>"	commence ended 1979 american recognize agreement call pay 1982 more had early ruled also by term made presidency decertified provision resulted legality background university bargaining unit other member who preparing from go involving wa an this union point next 1978 day unionize same 1935 over result national several employee for sympathy hold location were massachusetts boston many partially change service solidarity when month that following 5 private remained contract increase pyrrhic association respectively faculty reached college previous after chapter two court president collective they been year of action relation voted challenged but 14 international on 23 came particular april affected negotiation cancellation fully america it ruling side way end went tried striker unpopular some buaaup historian labor class state finally at u john perform protected particularly act under a their art zabel being mandated agreed neither contention not liberal tentative began and away receive disagreement sort distributive librarian supreme clerical previously united the professor aaup strike to worker silber unionized victory despite gary show buaaups expired any 1975 hundred initially ha few proved with reason solid recognition 1971 became in	1979 labor strike in Boston, Massachusetts, United States	labor state strike boston 1979 massachusetts in united	Companies
1985 Pan Am strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>1985 Pan Am strike</b> was a labor strike involving several thousand workers, all members of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), at Pan American World Airways. The strike began on February 28 and ended one month later on March 28. </p><p>During the 1980s, Pan Am was struggling financially, and in the early years of the decade, its five labor unions agreed to concessions in order to help the company remain financially stable. However, in December 1984, the labor contracts between Pan Am and the unions expired without replacements, with the unions requesting a lifting of the concessions that had included a pay freeze. TWU, which represented about 5,800 workers in various positions at the company, was especially vocal, and on February 28, after failing to come to an agreement with the company, they went on strike. Initially, the four other unions agreed to honor TWU's picket lines. However, after several days, citing concerns over the negative long-term impact a prolonged strike could have on the company, several unions (including those representing pilots and flight attendants) crossed the picket lines and returned to work. Following this, TWU and Pan Am agreed to meet for negotiations, which occurred throughout March and led to a tentative agreement being reached on March 23. In a narrow vote finalized on March 28, the union agreed to accept the contract (which contained similar provisions to the proposal Pan Am had made TWU before the strike) and ended the strike. While the contract included several concessions, the union also received annual pay increases of 5 percent for the duration of the contract. </p><p>The strike came during a difficult time in the relationship between organized labor and American airlines, with 14 strikes occurring at airlines between 1980 and 1986. Several of these strikes saw a high degree of interunion support. Historian David J. Walsh summarized the strike by saying that, while TWU won some gains alongside some concessions, the union's efforts were hurt by a breakdown in interunion support and genuine concerns from some unions over the negative effects of a long-term strike. Following the strike, Pan Am sold some of its assets in 1985 and in 1991, the company declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. </p>"	stable december ended these throughout american order agreement accept pay had early between time also by made requesting narrow provision won breakdown returned other summarized member occurred from financially involving wa without an longterm this union prolonged day including struggling over several honor for organized airline degree were those remain company replacement month citing that following freeze 5 contract later could j while increase effect support impact duration finalized reached high representing concern alongside interunion five after negative pan however they help asset percent represented year of received 1980 genuine contained led vocal before which 28 14 on included 23 1980s four came effort ceased negotiation 1991 america it saw went decade gain failing line pilot about similar some sold lifting am difficult historian labor 5800 proposal at march 1984 saying 1986 a airway twus attendant being all flight bankruptcy agreed walsh crossed february tentative began have and various one meet work picket twu thousand concession vote the come strike to worker position world david during especially expired occurring declared initially operation 1985 relationship hurt with annual in transport	1985 labor strike	labor 1985 strike	Companies

The workers, unionized as part of the United Auto Workers, began selective strikes at three Deere facilities on August 23, 1986. The selective strikes prompted Deere to close the rest of the facilities under the same labor contract as three striking locales, which the UAW, and later <i>The New York Times</i>, called a lockout. On February 1, 1987, workers ratified a tentative agreement which provided stronger benefits to Deere production employees.

2016 Jim Beam strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>2016 Jim Beam strike</b> was a labor strike involving about 250 workers for the Beam Suntory subsidiary of the Japanese alcohol company Suntory, which produces the Jim Beam brand of bourbon whiskey in the U.S. state of Kentucky. These workers, all union members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 111D, worked at two distillery facilities in Clermont and Boston, Kentucky. In 2016, this local union began to negotiate the terms of a new labor contract with the company, and although a tentative agreement had been reached by October 11, it was voted down by a ratio of about ten-to-one by the union members, who also authorized strike action. The primary concerns of the members involved included, among other issues, job security, scheduling, overtime, and the hiring of temporary workers in lieu of permanent, full-time employees. The contract negotiations came during a major boom period in bourbon production, and some workers at the distilleries reported having to work about 70 hours per week. Additionally, the number of temporary workers had increased drastically, and union members were seeking to have this number reduced and for the company to hire more permanent employees.

The strike was caused due to disagreements between the union and company concerning the terms of a new labor contract, with particular points of contention concerning the current two-tier wage system (with legacy workers making $35/hr and new hires $22/hr), health care, holidays, retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments, and vacation time. The strike affected all of Kellogg's cereal-producing plants in the United States, consisting of plants in Battle Creek, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee.

2021 Virginia Volvo Trucks strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>2021 Virginia Volvo Trucks strike</b> was a labor strike involving workers at a Volvo Trucks production facility in Dublin, Virginia, United States. The strike began in April and ended in July with the ratification of a new labor contract. </p><p>Of the 3,300 workers at the plant, 2,900 were union members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2069. In March 2021, the labor contract between the union and company expired, and while the union authorized a 30-day extension while both sides continued to negotiate the terms of a replacement, neither side could come to an agreement, with disagreements primarily covering wage increases, job securities, and health care, among other issues. As a result, on April 17, Local 2069 commenced with strike action against the plant, with workers picketing outside while negotiations continued. On April 30, the strike was called off after UAW announced a tentative agreement had been reached with the company. However, members voted to overwhelmingly reject this agreement on May 16 and proceeded to reject a second tentative agreement on June 6. Following this, on June 7, strike action recommenced. About a month after this, on July 9, union members rejected a third tentative agreement that had been reached between UAW and Volvo Trucks. On July 11, the company declared an impasse and stated they would be reopening the plant, with the third tentative agreement serving as their final offer to the union. In a vote held on July 14, union members narrowly voted to accept the terms of the agreement, with strikers returning to work on July 18, thus ending the strike. </p><p>The terms of the new contract included a $2,000 signing bonus for most of the union members, a 12 percent annual wage increase over the six-year life of the contract, and a price freeze on health care premiums for the duration of the contract, among other provisions. </p>"	continued ending ended july security offer agreement accept most care had june between would term announced provision 17 impasse narrowly facility auto rejected other member returning uaw involving wa an this union be over result for reopening were wage company replacement month premium off 2021 health following that held freeze production contract could commenced third while increase local plant among duration reached job 16 authorized after picketing 18 2069 dublin however they percent been of stated action thus 2000 7 final voted primarily truck both 30 14 on included 2900 april negotiation 6 side outside life about volvo striker extension 12 labor state recommenced at march 11 new 30day a reject their sixyear may signing issue neither proceeded covering tentative began and disagreement work 9 serving vote overwhelmingly second united the ratification negotiate come strike against bonus to worker called 3300 expired virginia declared with price annual in	Labor strike in Dublin, Virginia, US	labor dublin strike u in virginia	Companies
2021 Columbia University strike	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>2021–2022 Columbia University strike</b> was a labor strike involving graduate student workers at Columbia University in New York City. The strike began on March 15, 2021, and ended on May 13, 2021. However, additional strike action commenced on November 3 and lasted until January 7, 2022, when a tentative agreement with the university was reached. The strike was organized by the Graduate Workers of Columbia–United Auto Workers Local 2110 (SWC–UAW), a labor union representing student workers at the university. The goals of the strike were an increase in wages, increased healthcare and childcare coverage, and third-party arbitration in cases of discrimination and sexual harassment. </p><p>While the union voted in March 2020 to authorize strike action, these plans were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in February 2021, still without a labor contract, the union announced their intent to strike the following month. The strike began on March 15 as an open-ended strike action, with no set end date. The strike coincided with a tuition strike that had been coordinated by the local chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America. Picketing and other forms of protest were held at numerous Columbia locations throughout New York City, and multiple elected officials and politicians announced their support for the strikers. On April 19, a contract proposal was submitted for ratification by the union members, but it was rejected in a rank-and-file vote. Following this, a vote was held in early May to determine the future of the strike, with a majority of voters choosing to end the strike, which officially ended on May 13. </p><p>Following the end of the strike, on July 3, new leaders for the union were elected who promised to continue to push for a labor contract with the university. Additionally, the name of the union was changed to the Student Workers of Columbia. While negotiations were set to resume on August 25, disagreements between the two groups led to an impasse, and in late September, the union voted to authorize another strike action. This renewed strike action began on November 3 and continued through late 2021 and into early 2022. Mediation began in late December and on January 7, 2022, the union voted to stop striking after approving a tentative agreement between the university and union that included several concessions to the union, such as increased healthcare and childcare coverage, increased pay, and changes to the arbitration process at Columbia.

Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered based on two aspects: by whether they can issue stock, or by whether they are formed to make a profit. Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as <i>aggregate</i> (the subject of this article) or <i>sole</i> (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office occupied by a single natural person). </p><p>One of the most attractive early advantages business corporations offered to their investors, compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, was limited liability. Limited liability means that a passive shareholder in a corporation will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party. Limited liability in contract is uncontroversial because the parties to the contract could have agreed to it and could agree to waive it by contract. However, limited liability in tort remains controversial because third parties do not agree to waive the right to pursue shareholders. There is significant evidence that limited liability in tort may lead to excessive corporate risk taking and more harm by corporations to third parties.</p><p>Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as <i>stock corporations</i>; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as <i>stockholders</i> or <i>shareholders</i>. Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as <i>non-stock corporations</i>; i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a <i>member</i> of the corporation. Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as <i>for-profit</i> and <i>not-for-profit</i> corporations, respectively. </p><p>There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock. To simplify the explanation, whenever ""stockholder"" or ""shareholder"" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as ""member"" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation. Registered corporations have legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment. </p><p>Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company. </p><p>In American English, the word <i>corporation</i> is most often used to describe large business corporations. In British English and in the Commonwealth countries, the term <i>company</i> is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word <i>corporation</i> encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word <i>company</i> can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a separate legal entity. Late in the 19th century, a new form of the company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as <i>Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung</i> or <i>GmbH</i>. In the last quarter of the 20th century, this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the <i>limited liability company</i> or <i>LLC</i>. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1356 Cached time: 20220514120716 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.471 seconds Real time usage: 0.614 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1226/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 69249/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1502/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 11/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 20928/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.257/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5584971/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 520.061 1 -total 23.22% 120.761 2 Template:Sidebar_with_collapsible_lists 19.80% 102.962 3 Template:Cite_journal 17.49% 90.951 1 Template:Companies_law 13.12% 68.241 1 Template:Short_description 9.39% 48.855 1 Template:Sidebar 8.82% 45.854 1 Template:Pp-pc1 7.80% 40.549 1 Template:Capitalism_sidebar 7.71% 40.087 1 Template:Clarify 7.60% 39.542 1 Template:Pagetype -->"	ad remains investment pursue control american most number agree whose encompasses protection classified type subject more century would early between word party like also used by office incorporated monarch notforprofit term needing are always beschränkter haftung last joint large group instead other well member who where involuntary appoint right aspect can wa an passive include referred proprietorship this stockholder earlier forprofit chartered since same gmbh profit be manage british born alternative obtained overlap single for formed were context ie forprofitnotforprofit favorable many aggregate those very will uncontroversial hoc jurisdiction natural company distinguishes serve llc english that private controversial choose contract could allowed third while form because either harm local ability liable charter almost tort respectively typically occupied certain corporate stocknonstock allow often such two consisting though nonstock enterprise however they late board business even distinguished compared generally of actively article whether there explanation whenever is obligation discussed germany but share attractive now so elect officer on separate evidence partieswhere sole recognized it lead region representative waive advantage 19th organization risk noncorporate having feature statute contractually do organization—usually some out mit passed different director quarter law based stock rest usually partnership state significant entity act new a divided owner their taking granted considered mean may circumstance describe all issue nonprofit commonwealth limited or public legislature agreed creation 10 shareholder not owned have person depending and practice one sort make widely established simplify registered presumed company—authorized personality vote capacity registration country known refer united the investor come authority against membership personally to worker treatment corporation tax employ fiduciary legal purpose committed available developed excessive 20th technically people parliament gesellschaft codetermination with offered liability through became in	separate legal entity that has been incorporated through a legislative or registration process established through legislation	legislation registration entity ha or incorporated established process been a through legislative legal that separate	Companies
Corporatization	<p><b>Corporatization</b> is the process of transforming and restructuring state assets, government agencies, public organizations, or municipal organizations into corporations. It involves the adoption and application of business management practices and the separation of ownership from management through the creation of a joint-stock or shareholding structure for the organization. The result of corporatization is the creation of state-owned corporations (or corporations at other government levels, such as municipally owned corporations) where the government retains a majority ownership of the corporation's stock. Corporatization is undertaken to improve efficiency of an organization, to commercialize its operations, to introduce corporate and business management techniques to public functions, or as a precursor to partial or full privatization. </p>	for application function into or public is corporatization management creation owned partial and transforming practice majority restructuring process it adoption municipal improve full government efficiency the organization corporate jointstock to other technique corporation from where such stock structure municipally an state stateowned level ownership at operation separation privatization asset involves business retains commercialize a undertaken of through precursor introduce result agency shareholding	transformation of publicly owned or governmental organizations into business corporations	organization transformation governmental or into business corporation owned publicly of	Companies

Rubriq	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Scholarly peer review</b> or <b>academic peer review</b> (also known as <b>refereeing</b>) is the process of having a draft version of a researcher's methods and findings reviewed (usually anonymously) by experts (or ""peers"") in the same field. Peer review helps the academic publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief, the editorial board or the program committee) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected for official publication in an academic journal, a monograph or in the proceedings of an academic conference. </p><p>Academic peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) academic field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scholarly journals. However, peer review does not entirely prevent publication of invalid research, and as experimentally controlled studies of this process are difficult to arrange, direct evidence that peer review improves the quality of published papers is scarce.</p><p>Scholarly peer review has been subject to several criticisms, and various proposals for reforming the system have been suggested over the years. Many studies have emphasized the problems inherent to the process of peer review. (see Squazzoni et al. 2017). Moreover, Ragone et al., (2013) have shown that there is a low correlation between peer review outcomes and the future impact measured by citations. Brezis and Birukou also show that the Peer Review process is not working properly. They underline that the ratings are not robust, e.g., changing reviewers can have a dramatic impact on the review results. Two main elements affect the bias in the peer process.</p> <ul><li>The first element is that referees display homophily in their taste and perception of innovative ideas. So reviewers who are developing conventional ideas will tend to give low grades to innovative projects, while reviewers who have developed innovative ideas tend, by homophily, to give higher grades to innovative projects.</li> <li>The second element leading to a high variance in the peer review process is that reviewers are not investing the same amount of time to analyze the projects (or equivalently are not with the same abilities). Brezis and Biruku show that this heterogeneity among referees will lead to seriously affect the whole peer review process, and will lead to main arbitrariness in the results of the process.</li></ul><p>The peer process is also in use for projects acceptance. (For projects, the acceptance rates are small and are between 1% and 20%, with an average of 10%. In the European H2020 calls, the acceptance rate is 1.8%.) Peer review is more problematic when choosing the projects to be funded since innovative projects are not highly ranked in the existing peer-review process. The peer-review process leads to conformity, i.e., the selection of less controversial projects and papers. This may even influence the type of proposals scholars will propose, since scholars need to find financing for their research as discussed by Martin, 1997: ""A common informal view is that it is easier to obtain funds for conventional projects. Those who are eager to get funding are not likely to propose radical or unorthodox projects. Since you don't know who the referees are going to be, it is best to assume that they are middle-of-the-road. Therefore, the middle-of-the-road application is safer"".</p><p>Other attempts to reform the peer review process originate among others from the fields of metascience and journalology. Reformers seek to increase the reliability and efficiency of the peer review process and to provide it with a scientific foundation. Alternatives to common peer review practices have been put to the test, in particular <i>open peer review</i>, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well, e.g., F1000, <i>eLife</i>, <i>BMJ</i>, and BioMed Central.</p>"	higher rating reformer academic most conventional 2017 give call more type subject identity f1000 between researcher able also bad used by appreciated time choosing draft foundation comment significance are therefore controlled future reliability narrowly visible rejected well version who from where properly central open inherent can propose likely an never invalid low this since doe method leading investing same be quality eg over result variance you alternative should several for citation ie assume middleoftheroad application many highly birukou project will shown acceptance scholar major taste those when saferother others average seek best that test eager direct controversial journal biruku financing 1997 view while increase put given ability review among provide impact bmj small efficiency innovative high reform funding publisher often al need reviewed two 18 reasonably equivalently ragone editorinchief problematic however dramatic they grade conformity board help even expert entirely practice been existing year editorial of generally le prevent decide finding improves underline whether there robust is discussed et accepted criticism find so acceptable disclosed on ranked evidence committee monograph particular good referee it homophily lead metascience selection know brezis reforming revision display refereeing having official qualified obtain influence difficult easier originate usually community analyze requires proposal european seriously perform main interdisciplinary a their use scarcescholarly funded considered may problem scholarly dont idea element reviewer 20 conference paper measured or perception peerreview radical 1 10 not h2020 unorthodox contemporary going proceeding scientific have attempt emphasized suggested and 2013 various moreover anonymously impartial accomplish work correlation research first widely experimentally heterogeneity arbitrariness process developing tend defined known second system elife rate the affect to fund publication arrange especially common reader necessary show amount developed whole published outcome bias squazzoni journalology program processthe ha study with get working martin biomed peer see in field changing informal	process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, or research to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field	or others work research process are subjecting the scrutiny to who an author expert same of in field scholarly	Companies
Company store	"<p>A <b>company store</b> is a retail store selling a limited range of food, clothing and daily necessities to employees of a company. It is typical of a company town in a remote area where virtually everyone is employed by one firm, such as a coal mine. In a company town, the housing is owned by the company but there may be independent stores there or nearby. </p><p>A company store may also refer to a company's merchandise store, in which fans of a company or brand may purchase clothing and collectibles related to that brand. </p><p>Employee-only company stores often accept scrip or non-cash vouchers issued by the company in advance of periodic cash paychecks, and gives credit to employees before payday. Except in very remote areas, company stores in mining towns became scarcer after the miners bought automobiles and could travel to a range of stores. Even so, the stores could survive because they provided convenience and easy credit. Company stores served numerous additional functions, as well, such as a locus for the government post office, and as the cultural and community center where people could freely gather.</p><p>Company stores have had a reputation as monopolistic institutions, funneling workers' incomes back to the owners of the company. This is because company stores often faced little or no competition for workers' earnings on account of their geographical remoteness, the inability and/or unwillingness of other nearby merchants (if any existed) to accept company scrip, or both. Prices, therefore, were typically high. Allowing purchases on credit enforced a kind of debt slavery, obligating employees to remain with the company until the debt was cleared. </p><p>Regarding this reputation, economic historian Price V. Fishback wrote: </p> <blockquote><p>The company store is one of the most reviled and misunderstood of economic institutions. In song, folktale, and union rhetoric the company store was often cast as a villain, a collector of souls through perpetual debt peonage. Nicknames, like the ""pluck me"" and more obscene versions that cannot appear in a family newspaper, seem to point to exploitation. The attitudes carry over into the scholarly literature, which emphasizes that the company store was a monopoly.</p></blockquote> <p>(The songs Fishback mentions include the popular song ""Sixteen Tons"", which contains such lines as ""Saint Peter, don't you call me, 'cuz I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store."") </p><p>Company stores existed elsewhere than the United States, in particular in the early 1900s in Mexico, where textile workers at the largest cotton mill were paid in scrip. In a 1907 labor strike, workers attacked and looted the Río Blanco, Veracruz textile company's store. The workers were gunned down by the Mexican military, but in the aftermath of the violence, more retail outlets were opened in Rio Blanco.</p><p>Possibly the first company store in the world was in Hawaii. William Hooper started Hawaiiʻs first sugar plantation in 1835 at Koloa, on the island of Kauai. He hired 23 Hawaiian locals and paid them in a cardboard scrip, notated in various amounts. The scrip could only be exchanged for merchandise at his store.

Shareholders' agreement	<p>A <b>shareholders' agreement</b> (sometimes referred to in the U.S. as a <b>stockholders' agreement</b>) (SHA) is an agreement amongst the shareholders or members of a company. In practical effect, it is analogous to a partnership agreement. It can be said that some jurisdictions fail to give a proper definition to the concept of shareholders' agreement, however particular consequences of this agreements are defined so far. There are advantages of the shareholder's agreement; to be specific, it helps the corporate entity to maintain the absence of publicity and keep the confidentiality. Nonetheless, there are also some disadvantages that should be considered, such as the limited effect to the third parties (especially assignees and share purchasers) and alternation of the stipulated articles can be time consuming. </p>	practical article consequence purchaser said there sometimes or limited is agreement shareholder company jurisdiction give keep share that so publicity and party also alternation particular time sha third it effect are defined consuming amongst analogous concept the advantage corporate absence to fail some member especially disadvantage maintain such stipulated partnership can confidentiality an nonetheless however referred u entity stockholder this far help proper a assignee definition of be specific in considered should	or stockholders' agreement	stockholder or agreement	Companies
One share, one vote	<p><b>One share, one vote</b> is a standard found in corporate law and corporate governance, which suggests that each person who invests money in a company has one vote per share of the company they own, equally with other shareholders.

Corporate governance	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1045330069""><p><b>Corporate governance</b> is defined, described or delineated in diverse ways, depending on the writer's purpose. Writers focussed on a disciplinary interest or context (such as accounting, finance, law, or management) often adopt narrow definitions that appear purpose-specific. Writers concerned with regulatory policy in relation to corporate governance practices often use broader structural descriptions. A broad (meta) definition that encompasses many adopted definitions is '“Corporate governance” describes the processes, structures, and mechanisms that influence the control and direction of corporations'. </p><p>This meta definition accommodates both the narrow definitions used in specific contexts and the broader descriptions that are often presented as authoritative. The latter include: the structural definition from the Cadbury Report, which identifies corporate governance as 'the system by which companies are directed and controlled' (Cadbury 1992, p. 15); and the relational-structural view adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 'Corporate governance involves a set of relationships between a company's management, its board, its shareholders and other stakeholders. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance are determined' (OECD 2015, p.9). . </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1422 Cached time: 20220514120739 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [] CPU time usage: 0.157 seconds Real time usage: 0.207 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 376/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 37720/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 3372/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 8/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 6516/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.077/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 1610127/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 149.918 1 -total 44.93% 67.351 1 Template:Short_description 41.97% 62.918 1 Template:Governance 40.25% 60.349 1 Template:Sidebar 22.30% 33.439 1 Template:Pagetype 12.92% 19.370 1 Template:Business_administration 11.46% 17.188 1 Template:Sidebar_with_collapsible_lists 10.88% 16.311 2 Template:Main_other 8.39% 12.584 1 Template:SDcat 7.46% 11.188 1 Template:Portal-inline -->"	control encompasses presented p between writer description identifies also used by narrow are controlled delineated latter other from describes oecd structure “ include development 2015 this p9 governance authoritative for context provides many diverse economic those finance company that view monitoring described directed relationalstructural focussed broad corporate often 15 such cadbury board attaining disciplinary of relation which both is set concerned adopted ” appear on report it way objective interest adopt cooperation organization influence law determined performance a accounting definition use mean structural or policy management shareholder accommodates broader depending and practice process purposespecific stakeholder defined system the to corporation regulatory direction mechanism purpose 1992 meta relationship involves with specific through in	mechanisms, processes and relations by which corporations are controlled and operated	and relation which operated by corporation process are mechanism controlled	Companies
Company seal	<p>A <b>company seal</b> (sometimes referred to as the <b>corporate seal</b> or <b>common seal</b>) is an official seal used by a company.

It may have further seals for other territories and for issuing securities. These seals have the additional legend of the territory or the word SECURITIES. A company may wish still to seal documents as a means of protection against forgery.</p><p>Traditionally, the seal was of some legal significance because the affixing of the seal signified that the document was the act and deed of the company, whereas when a document was merely signed by a director, then that was deemed to be an act carried out on behalf of the company by its agents, which was subject to applicable restrictions and limitations under the ordinary law of agency. </p><p>Corporate seals are generally only used for two purposes by corporations today: </p> <ul><li>Documents which need to be executed as deeds (as opposed to simple contracts), may be executed under the company's common seal</li> <li>Certain corporate documents, for example share certificates are often issued under the company seal (and some countries required that share certificates be issued under the common seal).

In this case, an owner does not consolidate the associate's financial statements. Ownership of over 50% creates a subsidiary, with its financial statements being consolidated into the parent's books. Associate value is reported in the balance sheet as an asset, the investor's proportional share of the associate's income is reported in the income statement and dividends from the ownership decrease the value on the balance sheet. In Europe, investments into associate companies are called fixed financial assets. </p><p>Associate value in the enterprise value equation is the reciprocate of minority interest. </p><p>Under the UK Companies Act 2006, two companies are ""associated"" if one company is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of the same body corporate.</p>"	case investment statement equation sheet book are europe decrease other from minority financial an this doe same 20–50 over reported company another 2006 corporate associate income two enterprise business asset uk of which both is subsidiary share on creates portion it interest value proportional usually fixed significant dividend act under accounting a owner being into or 50 consolidate not valuation and balance reciprocate one if voting the investor called body consolidated ownership parent with owns associated in	accounting and business valuation concept	and business accounting valuation concept	Companies
Staggered elections	<p><b>Staggered elections</b> are elections where only some of the places in an elected body are up for election at the same time. For example, United States Senators have a six-year term, but they are not all elected at the same time. Rather, elections are held every two years for one-third of Senate seats. </p><p>Staggered elections have the effect of limiting control of a representative body by the body being represented, but can also minimize the impact of cumulative voting.

Financial law	<p><b>Financial law</b> is the law and regulation of the insurance, derivatives, commercial banking, capital markets and investment management sectors. Understanding Financial law is crucial to appreciating the creation and formation of banking and financial regulation, as well as the legal framework for finance generally. Financial law forms a substantial portion of commercial law, and notably a substantial proportion of the global economy, and legal billables are dependent on sound and clear legal policy pertaining to financial transactions. Therefore financial law as the law for financial industries involves public and private law matters. Understanding the legal implications of transactions and structures such as an indemnity, or overdraft is crucial to appreciating their effect in financial transactions. This is the core of Financial law. Thus, Financial law draws a narrower distinction than commercial or corporate law by focusing primarily on financial transactions, the financial market, and its participants; for example, the sale of goods may be part of commercial law but is not financial law. Financial law may be understood as being formed of three overarching methods, or <i>pillars</i> of law formation and categorised into five <i>transaction silos</i> which form the various financial positions prevalent in finance. </p><p>For the regulation of the financial markets, see Financial regulation which is distinguished from financial law in that regulation sets out the guidelines, framework and participatory rules of the financial markets, their stability and protection of consumers; whereas financial law describes the law pertaining to all aspects of finance, including the law which controls party behaviour in which financial regulation forms an aspect of that law.</p><p>Financial law is understood as consisting of three pillars of law formation, these serve as the operating mechanisms on which the law interacts with the financial system and financial transactions generally. These three components, being market practices, case law, and regulation; work collectively to set a framework upon which financial markets operate. Whilst regulation experienced a resurgence following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the role of case law and market practices cannot be understated. Further, whilst regulation is often formulated through legislative practices; market norms and case law serve as primary architects to the current financial system and provide the pillars upon which the markets depend. It is crucial for strong markets to be capable of utilising both self-regulation and conventions as well as commercially mined case law. This must be in addition to regulation. An improper balance of the three pillars is likely to result in instability and rigidity within the market contributing to illiquidity. For example, the <i>soft law</i> of the <i>Potts QC Opinion</i> in 1997 reshaped the derivatives market and helped expand the prevalence of derivatives. These three pillars are underpinned by several legal concepts upon which financial law depends, notably, legal personality, set-off, and payment which allows legal scholars to categorise financial instruments and financial market structures into five legal silos; those being (1) simple positions, (2) funded positions, (3) asset-backed positions, (4) net positions, and (5) combined positions. These are used by academic Joanna Benjamin to highlight the distinctions between various groupings of transaction structures based on common underpinnings of treatment under the law. The five position types are used as a framework to understand the legal treatment and corresponding constraints of instruments used in finance (such as, for example, a guarantee or asset-backed security.) </p>	case investment component these control expand grouping stability security academic proportion protection behaviour type between party used by whilst sale are therefore implication formulated consumer prevalence allows concept benjamin must distinction well draw collectively banking role from potts legislative describes part norm structure aspect experienced financial can an likely upon framework this understanding method qc participant dependent be including resurgence result architect several for formed overarching substantial operating depends scholar those utilising finance simple capital serve crisis current that following silo 5 private 1997 understand guarantee prevalent form lawfinancial mined depend illiquidity effect provide opinion underpinnings corporate economy rule reshaped five industry derivative pertaining regulation often such consisting narrower operate distinguished generally of thus three pillar commercial which interacts primarily payment both is rigidity set addition improper sound but participatory sector soft assetbacked insurance on joanna setoff contributing matter good portion it convention strong categorised categorise out global transaction law based 4 market instability crucial further under a their funded primary may being overdraft all capable within into policy public or management creation 1 not example and balance various practice notably billables work 2 commercially focusing corresponding instrument personality net system combined whereas the guideline highlight understood than to position selfregulation treatment underpinned clear common core understated mechanism legal 3 constraint indemnity appreciating involves with helped through see in formation 2007–2008	area of law that regulates insurance, derivatives, commercial banking, capital markets and investment management sectors	and market commercial investment regulates banking management derivative capital of law area sector that insurance	Companies

EU	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>European Union</b> (<b>EU</b>) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The union has a total area of 4,233,255.3 km<sup>2</sup> (1,634,469.0 sq mi) and an estimated total population of about 447<span> </span>million. An internal single market has been established through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area. The eurozone is a monetary union established in 1999, coming into full force in 2002, that is composed of the 19 EU member states that use the euro currency. The EU has often been described as a <i>sui generis</i> political entity (without precedent or comparison) with the characteristics of either a federation or confederation.</p><p>The union and EU citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993. The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The original member states of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of 21 new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009. In 2020, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU. Before this, four territories of current member states had left the EU or its forerunners. There are several other countries that are negotiating to join the European Union. </p><p>Containing some 5.8 percent of the world population in 2020, the EU had generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around <span>US$17.1</span><span> </span>trillion in 2021, constituting approximately 18 percent of global nominal GDP. Additionally, all EU countries have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20.

Board of directors	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>A <b>board of directors</b> (commonly referred simply as <b>the board</b>) is an executive committee that jointly supervise the activities of an organization, which can be either a for-profit or a nonprofit organization such as a business, nonprofit organization, or a government agency. </p><p>The powers, duties, and responsibilities of a board of directors are determined by government regulations (including the jurisdiction's corporate law) and the organization's own constitution and by-laws. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet. </p><p>In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and may be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually elect the members of the board. In a stock corporation, non-executive directors are elected by the shareholders, and the board has ultimate responsibility for the management of the corporation. In nations with codetermination (such as Germany and Sweden), the workers of a corporation elect a set fraction of the board's members. </p><p>The board of directors appoints the chief executive officer of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation.

Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered based on two aspects: by whether they can issue stock, or by whether they are formed to make a profit. Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as <i>aggregate</i> (the subject of this article) or <i>sole</i> (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office occupied by a single natural person). </p><p>One of the most attractive early advantages business corporations offered to their investors, compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, was limited liability. Limited liability means that a passive shareholder in a corporation will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party. Limited liability in contract is uncontroversial because the parties to the contract could have agreed to it and could agree to waive it by contract. However, limited liability in tort remains controversial because third parties do not agree to waive the right to pursue shareholders. There is significant evidence that limited liability in tort may lead to excessive corporate risk taking and more harm by corporations to third parties.</p><p>Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as <i>stock corporations</i>; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as <i>stockholders</i> or <i>shareholders</i>. Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as <i>non-stock corporations</i>; i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a <i>member</i> of the corporation. Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as <i>for-profit</i> and <i>not-for-profit</i> corporations, respectively. </p><p>There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock. To simplify the explanation, whenever ""stockholder"" or ""shareholder"" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as ""member"" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation. Registered corporations have legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment. </p><p>Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company. </p><p>In American English, the word <i>corporation</i> is most often used to describe large business corporations. In British English and in the Commonwealth countries, the term <i>company</i> is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word <i>corporation</i> encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word <i>company</i> can include entities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a separate legal entity. Late in the 19th century, a new form of the company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as <i>Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung</i> or <i>GmbH</i>. In the last quarter of the 20th century, this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the <i>limited liability company</i> or <i>LLC</i>. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1356 Cached time: 20220514120716 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.471 seconds Real time usage: 0.614 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1226/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 69249/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1502/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 11/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 20928/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.257/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5584971/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 520.061 1 -total 23.22% 120.761 2 Template:Sidebar_with_collapsible_lists 19.80% 102.962 3 Template:Cite_journal 17.49% 90.951 1 Template:Companies_law 13.12% 68.241 1 Template:Short_description 9.39% 48.855 1 Template:Sidebar 8.82% 45.854 1 Template:Pp-pc1 7.80% 40.549 1 Template:Capitalism_sidebar 7.71% 40.087 1 Template:Clarify 7.60% 39.542 1 Template:Pagetype -->"	ad remains investment pursue control american most number agree whose encompasses protection classified type subject more century would early between word party like also used by office incorporated monarch notforprofit term needing are always beschränkter haftung last joint large group instead other well member who where involuntary appoint right aspect can wa an passive include referred proprietorship this stockholder earlier forprofit chartered since same gmbh profit be manage british born alternative obtained overlap single for formed were context ie forprofitnotforprofit favorable many aggregate those very will uncontroversial hoc jurisdiction natural company distinguishes serve llc english that private controversial choose contract could allowed third while form because either harm local ability liable charter almost tort respectively typically occupied certain corporate stocknonstock allow often such two consisting though nonstock enterprise however they late board business even distinguished compared generally of actively article whether there explanation whenever is obligation discussed germany but share attractive now so elect officer on separate evidence partieswhere sole recognized it lead region representative waive advantage 19th organization risk noncorporate having feature statute contractually do organization—usually some out mit passed different director quarter law based stock rest usually partnership state significant entity act new a divided owner their taking granted considered mean may circumstance describe all issue nonprofit commonwealth limited or public legislature agreed creation 10 shareholder not owned have person depending and practice one sort make widely established simplify registered presumed company—authorized personality vote capacity registration country known refer united the investor come authority against membership personally to worker treatment corporation tax employ fiduciary legal purpose committed available developed excessive 20th technically people parliament gesellschaft codetermination with offered liability through became in	separate legal entity that has been incorporated through a legislative or registration process established through legislation	legislation registration entity ha or incorporated established process been a through legislative legal that separate	Companies
Creature of statute	"<p>A <b>creature of statute</b> (also known as <b>creature of the state</b>) is a legal entity, such as a corporation, created by statute. Creatures of statute may include municipalities and other artificial legal entities or relationships. Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as ""creatures of statute."" The same concept is also expressed with the phrase ""creature of the state.""</p><p>The term ""creature of statute"" is most common to the United States. In the United Kingdom, these bodies are simply called statutory corporations (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the Companies Act 1985 specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (<i>e.g.</i>, a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as ""creatures of statute"" to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. Australia also uses the term ""creature of statute"" to describe some governmental bodies. </p><p>The importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of statute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas. </p>"	these expand american most unlike us also by term are therefore speak concept kingdom other member phrase can scope an include since governmental municipality same be eg area national for formed diverse jurisdiction company when purposes—such that fashion private sense given written described small governing simply corporate often such them regardless board business tangible generally of thus uk which function is importance detailed but expressed it australia interest government origin functional document statute some china law governs statutory energy state requires entity act under a their created creature may describe atomic manifestation statethe within or public limited into not example body—often inform have and work specifies although artificial known wider thereby exact united the authority to body called corporation common reader legal only active how relationship 1985 format with in formation	corporation or entity created by statute law	entity by statute or corporation created law	Companies
Oppression remedy	<p>In corporate law in Commonwealth countries, an <b>oppression remedy</b> is a statutory right available to oppressed shareholders.

Corporate haven	"<p>A <b>corporate haven</b>, <b>corporate tax haven</b>, or <b>multinational tax haven</b>, is used to describe a jurisdiction that multinational corporations find attractive for establishing subsidiaries or incorporation of regional or main company headquarters, mostly due to favourable tax regimes (not just the headline tax rate), and/or favourable secrecy laws (such as the avoidance of regulations or disclosure of tax schemes), and/or favourable regulatory regimes (such as weak data-protection or employment laws). </p><p>While the ""headline"" corporate tax rate in jurisdictions most often implicated in base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is always above zero (e.g. Netherlands at 25%, U.K. at 19%, Singapore at 17%, and Ireland at 12.5%), the ""effective"" tax rate (ETR) of multinational corporations, net of the BEPS tools, is closer to zero. To increase respectability, and access to tax treaties, some jurisdictions like Singapore and Ireland require corporates to have a ""substantive presence"", equating to an ""employment tax"" of approximately 2–3% of profits shielded and if these are real jobs, the tax is mitigated. </p><p>In corporate tax haven lists, CORPNET's ""Orbis connections"", ranks the Netherlands, U.K., Switzerland, Ireland, and Singapore as the world's key corporate tax havens, while Zucman's ""quantum of funds"" ranks Ireland as the largest global corporate tax haven. In proxy tests, Ireland is the largest recipient of U.S. tax inversions (the U.K. is third, the Netherlands is fifth). Ireland's double Irish BEPS tool is credited with the largest build-up of untaxed corporate offshore cash in history. Luxembourg and Hong Kong and the Caribbean ""triad"" (BVI-Cayman-Bermuda), have elements of corporate tax havens, but also of traditional tax havens. </p><p>Unlike traditional tax havens, modern corporate tax havens reject they have anything to do with near-zero effective tax rates, due to their need to encourage jurisdictions to enter into bilateral tax treaties which accept the haven's BEPS tools. CORPNET show each corporate tax haven is strongly connected with specific traditional tax havens (via additional BEPS tool ""backdoors"" like the double Irish, the dutch sandwich, and single malt). Corporate tax havens promote themselves as ""knowledge economies"", and IP as a ""new economy"" asset, rather than a tax management tool, which is encoded into their statute books as their primary BEPS tool. This perceived respectability encourages corporates to use these IFCs as regional headquarters (i.e. Google, Apple, and Facebook use Ireland in EMEA over Luxembourg, and Singapore in APAC over Hong Kong/Taiwan. </p><p>Economic Substance legislation introduced in recent years has identified that BEPS is not a material part of the financial services business for Cayman, BVI and Bermuda. While the legislation was originally resisted on extraterritoriality, human rights, privacy, international justice, jurisprudence and colonialism grounds, the introduction of these regulations have had the effect of putting these jurisdictions far ahead of onshore regulatory regimes. </p>"	these above human ip most offshore accept unlike had dataprotection fifth real like history used regime also book switzerland haven shifting enter are always 17 19 connection kong additional cash material disclosure avoidance part right multinational triad credited financial recipient an wa facebook due this andor presence perceived ground effective profit eg apple substantive malt over for single encourages ie inversion nearzero economic recent quantum jurisdiction company service that test apac 25 jurisprudence each third while increase google etr netherlands singapore proxy effect encoded caribbean 125 luxembourg corporate job economy onshore introduction encourage often regulation need such mitigated knowledge incorporation closer they via substance asset business far bilateral dutch year uk of respectability just themselves which strongly access identified is traditional subsidiary but find attractive favourable rather international emea on colonialism list zero secrecy introduced erosion modern corpnets originally irish base shielded equating cayman statute corpnet do some promote employment global tool law approximately untaxed at u buildup kongtaiwan main new corporates a reject their use headquarters hong primary bermuda describe privacy mostly element establishing or scheme into resisted treaty management not have weak sandwich and largest ifc if anything putting zucmans extraterritoriality double rank justice net headline rate the backdoor than to ahead fund world corporation tax regulatory 2–3 show connected legislation beps bvi implicated orbis ha regional bvicaymanbermuda ireland key with specific require in	jurisdiction favorable to corporations due to low taxes or weak regulations	favorable low due to or corporation jurisdiction tax regulation weak	Companies

Corruption	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Corruption</b> is a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken by a person or an organization which is entrusted with a position of authority, in order to acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain. Corruption may involve many activities which include bribery, influence peddling and embezzlement, and it may also involve practices which are legal in many countries. Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most common in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states, and mafia states.</p><p>Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degrees and proportions. Each individual nation allocates domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and the deterrence of crime. Strategies which are undertaken in order to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term anti-corruption. Additionally, global initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 also have a targeted goal which is supposed to substantially reduce corruption in all of its forms.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1388 Cached time: 20220514120846 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.226 seconds Real time usage: 0.306 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 447/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 7195/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1274/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 12/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 4078/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.132/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 2947222/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 281.434 1 -total 32.36% 91.069 2 Template:Cite_web 27.57% 77.590 1 Template:Short_description 16.45% 46.301 1 Template:Citation_needed 14.20% 39.969 1 Template:Fix 13.76% 38.724 1 Template:Pagetype 11.25% 31.665 1 Template:Redirect 8.52% 23.983 2 Template:Category_handler 8.21% 23.104 1 Template:Use_dmy_dates 7.51% 21.138 4 Template:Main_other -->"	control order most proportion umbrella supposed initiative also like by dishonesty term are crime other domestic summarized benefit entrusted an include development governmental undertaken anticorruption kleptocracies employee for degree mafia many when activity peddling frequency each form additionally individual bribery 16 narcostates regulation often allocates of offense oligarchy which strategy occurs is abuse appear resource on personal endemic it political acquire gain organization official criminal influence occurrence global corruption statescorruption goal act involve nation under a power virtually officeholder may deterrence all reduce or varying sociological have person and practice one sustainable capacity country united the authority embezzlement to position targeted common substantially legal scale with illicit regular in counter	form of dishonesty or criminal offense undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, to acquire illicit benefit or abuse power for one's private gain	for or person abuse private one by dishonesty form acquire gain authority organization to position criminal benefit entrusted with undertaken a illicit of power offense	Companies

Legal person	"<p>In law, a <b>legal person</b> is any person or 'thing' (less ambiguously, any <b>legal entity</b>) that can do the things a human person is usually able to do in law – such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on. The reason for the term ""<i>legal</i> person"" is that some legal persons are not people: companies and corporations are ""persons"" legally speaking (they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do), but they are not people in a literal sense. </p><p>There are therefore two kinds of legal entities: human and non-human. In law, a human person is called a <i>natural person</i> (sometimes also a <i>physical person</i>), and a non-human person is called a <i>juridical person</i> (sometimes also a <i>juridic</i>, <i>juristic</i>, <i>artificial</i>, <i>legal</i>, or <i><b>fictitious person</b></i>, Latin: <i lang=""la"">persona ficta</i>). </p><p>Juridical persons are entities such as corporations, firms (in some jurisdictions), and many government agencies. They are treated in law as if they were persons.</p><p>While natural persons acquire legal personality ""naturally"", simply by being born (or before that, in some jurisdictions), juridical persons must have legal personality conferred on them by some ""unnatural"", legal process, and it is for this reason that they are sometimes called ""artificial"" persons. In the most common case (incorporating a business), legal personality is usually acquired by registration with a government agency set up for the purpose. In other cases it may be by primary legislation: an example is the Charity Commission in the UK. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 advocates for the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration by 2030 as part of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>As legal personality is a prerequisite to legal capacity (the ability of any legal person to amend – i.e. enter into, transfer, etc. – rights and obligations), it is a prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its own name. </p><p>The term ""legal person"" can be ambiguous because it is often used as a synonym of terms that refer <i>only</i> to non-human legal entities, specifically in contradistinction to ""natural person"".</p> "	case human sometimes most juristic prerequisite identity legally able also used by term enter ordinary are therefore provision birth must other 2030 nonhuman part right can treated charity an development this be including born specifically for personswhile commission were ie many etc ambiguously natural jurisdiction company that sense contract literal because ability synonym simply persona 16 firm conferred ambiguous often such two them up sue kind they unnatural business uk of le ficta incorporating sued before amend there latin is obligation set but international so thing own on it acquire government advocate organization – do some property naturally law agendaas usually entity goal nation a juridical primary may acquired being all into or treaty not example have person and juridic if transfer process artificial personality sustainable capacity registration sign refer united the to called corporation common legal fictitious purpose only any legislation people with reason speaking name contradistinction physical in agency	any human or non-human entity that is recognized as having privileges and obligations; a legal fiction which is used to abstract away the differences between natural persons, juridical persons and other entities such as countries	privilege which human or is obligation natural that person and between away abstract used recognized fiction country difference the having to other nonhuman such legal any entity a juridical	Companies

The Modern Corporation and Private Property	"<p><i><b>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</b></i> is a book written by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means published in 1932 regarding the foundations of United States corporate law. It explores the evolution of big business through a legal and economic lens, and argues that in the modern world those who legally have ownership over companies have been separated from their control. The second, revised edition was released in 1967. It serves as a foundational text in corporate governance, corporate law (company law), and institutional economics. </p><p>Berle and Means argued that the structure of corporate law in the United States in the 1930s enforced the separation of ownership and control because the corporate person formally owns a corporate entity even while shareholders own shares in the corporate entity and elect corporate directors who control the company's activities.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 91"">: 91 </span></sup></b> <i>The Modern Corporation and Private Property,</i> first brought forward issues associated with the widely dispersed ownership of publicly traded companies.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 91"">: 91 </span></sup></b> Berle and Means showed that the means of production in the US economy were highly concentrated in the hands of the largest 200 corporations, and within the large corporations, managers controlled firms despite shareholders' formal ownership.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 91"">: 91 </span></sup></b> Compared to the notion of personal private property, say as one's laptop or bicycle, the functioning of modern company law “has destroyed the unity that we commonly call property.” This occurred for a number of reasons, foremost being the dispersal of shareholding ownership in big corporations: the typical shareholder is uninterested in the day-to-day affairs of the company, yet thousands of people like him or her make up the majority of owners throughout the economy. The result is that those who are directly interested in day-to-day affairs, the management and the directors, have the ability to manage the resources of companies to their own advantage without effective shareholder scrutiny. </p> <blockquote><p>“The property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders his wealth to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely recipient of the wages of capital... [Such owners] have surrendered the right that the corporation should be operated in their sole interest...” “the owners most emphatically will not be served by a profit seeking controlling group”.</p></blockquote> <p>The implications of their work were clear. Berle and Means advocated embedded voting rights for all shareholders, greater transparency, and accountability.

It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently it had to include the ""objects clause"" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital.

Volkseigener Betrieb	"<p>The <b>Publicly Owned Enterprise</b> (German: <i lang=""de"">Volkseigener Betrieb</i>; abbreviated <b>VEB</b>) was the main legal form of industrial enterprise in East Germany. They were all publicly owned and were formed after mass nationalisation between 1945 and the early 1960s, and the handing back in 1954 of some 33 enterprises previously taken by the Soviet Union as reparations.</p><p>The managing director of a VEB was called a plant or works manager (German: <i>Werkleiter</i>, <i>Werkdirektor</i> or <i>Betriebsdirektor</i>). He or she was assisted by the first secretary of the factory party organisation (<i>Betriebsparteiorganisation</i>) of the SED, and the chairman of the factory trade union (<i>Betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung</i>). Subordinate to them were roles such as ""Chief Accountant"" and ""Technical Director"". </p><p>VEBs were initially vertically integrated into units called Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises (<i>Vereinigung Volkseigener Betriebe</i>, VVBs). A VVB existed in most major industries to consolidate production and reduce waste. They had all been replaced by 1979 with the <i>VEB Kombinate</i>, or VEB Group, which integrated the VEBs much more closely than the largely administrative VVBs. Under this system, the term 'Kombinate' was frequently dropped and the term ""VEB"" usually implied the group rather than the individual factory. The organisation of all state enterprises was the responsibility of the State Planning Commission. </p><p>VEBs often had company sports teams, and played an important role in the promotion of sports. </p><p>In 1989, VEBs employed 79.9% of the East German workforce. After German reunification and the introduction of the market economy in 1990, the ownership of around 8,000 publicly owned enterprises passed to Treuhand, the trust agency which oversaw the privatization of GDR state property. </p><p>An honorary name was frequently added to the firm's actual name, for example, VEB Kombinat Chemische Werke ""Walter Ulbricht"" Leuna. This was a socialist emulation incentive towards fulfillment and overfulfillment of production quotas. Many Germans, as a form of mild protest against the nationalization of private businesses, nicknamed the VEBs <i>Vatis ehemaliger Betrieb</i>, which translates to ""Daddy's former business"".</p>"	1979 1990 promotion most sport more had quota played between early party overfulfillment by term 33 werkdirektor group unit largely role daddy added kombinat socialist wa an this union he publicly industrial betriebe factory taken for integrated formed were commission much many former ehemaliger major company planning incentive managing private production vvb volkseigener gdr form plant mild association german existed technical individual economy she firm mass betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung industry implied east after often introduction such them treuhand 1989 vertically enterprise they nationalisation privatization business been of chemische responsibility 1945 which veb 1954 trust oversaw germany vvbs rather kombinate replaced 8000 betrieb chief closely dropped vebs assisted nicknamed subordinate frequently around accountant secretary vereinigung some property passed director translates usually administrative state market manager workforce main under a soviet protest all reduce into or waste emulation owned sed consolidate example betriebsparteiorganisation werke betriebsdirektor honorary and first reparationsthe work organisation employed towards handing previously system trade actual the 1960s important against nationalization than to vatis chairman called team ulbricht abbreviated legal initially ownership walter reunification 799 back with name leuna werkleiter fulfillment in agency	former main legal form of industrial enterprise in East Germany	enterprise in former form main industrial east of germany legal	Companies
Proxy fight	"<p>A <b>proxy fight</b>, <b>proxy contest</b> or <b>proxy battle</b> (sometimes even called a <b>proxy war</b>) is an unfriendly contest for the control over an organization. The event usually occurs when a corporation's stockholders develop opposition to some aspect of the corporate governance, often focusing on directorial and management positions. Corporate activists may attempt to persuade shareholders to use their proxy votes (i.e., votes by one individual or institution as the authorized representative of another) to install new management for any of a variety of reasons. Shareholders of a public corporation may appoint an agent to attend shareholder meetings and vote on their behalf. That agent is the shareholder's proxy.</p><p>In a proxy fight, incumbent directors and management have the odds stacked in their favor over those trying to force the corporate change. These incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power, including: staggering the boards (i.e., having different election years for different directors), controlling access to the corporation's money, and creating restrictive requirements in the bylaws. As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful; except those waged more recently by hedge funds, which are successful more than 60% of the time. However, previous studies have found that proxy fights are positively correlated with an increase in shareholder wealth.<b><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 8"">: 8 </span></sup></b> </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1376 Cached time: 20220514120913 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.192 seconds Real time usage: 0.233 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 357/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 4713/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 50/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 4244/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.128/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 2684830/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 218.400 1 -total 51.39% 112.226 1 Template:Cite_book 27.26% 59.526 1 Template:Distinguish 13.62% 29.739 1 Template:Rp 12.10% 26.418 1 Template:R/superscript 5.50% 12.016 3 Template:R/where 4.34% 9.470 1 Template:Cite_journal -->"	these control sometimes most successful more bylaw time by contest are correlated 8 fight activist unfriendly appoint aspect an stockholder governance tactic including over result for ie those change when unsuccessful hedge that war another increase proxy incumbent except individual corporate opposition authorized previous often money waged however install force board even year of 60 which occurs access is directorial on attend develop odds representative institution staggering trying organization having event creating some controlling different director behalf usually agent stacked new a their power use stay may battle found or public management requirement shareholder variety have attempt and various one favor positively focusing restrictive vote the than to position election called fund corporation proxyin any meeting study with reason persuade recently wealth in	attempting to influence how company shareholders use their proxy votes	how to attempting influence shareholder company their proxy use vote	Companies
Piercing the corporate veil	"<p> <b>Piercing the corporate veil</b> or <b>lifting the corporate veil</b> is a legal decision to treat the rights or duties of a corporation as the rights or liabilities of its shareholders. Usually a corporation is treated as a separate legal person, which is solely responsible for the debts it incurs and the sole beneficiary of the credit it is owed. Common law countries usually uphold this principle of separate personhood, but in exceptional situations may ""pierce"" or ""lift"" the corporate veil.</p><p>A simple example would be where a businessman has left his job as a director and has signed a contract to not compete with the company he has just left for a period of time. If he sets up a company which competed with his former company, technically it would be the company and not the person competing. But it is likely a court would say that the new company was just a ""sham"" or a ""cover""; and that as the new company is completely owned and controlled by one person that the former employee is deliberately choosing to compete, and so is in breach of that non-competing contract. </p><p>Despite the terminology used which makes it appear as though a shareholder's limited liability emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity, the reality is that the entity status of corporations has almost nothing to do with shareholder limited liability. For example, English law conferred entity status on corporations long before shareholders were afforded limited liability. Similarly, the United States' Revised Uniform Partnership Act confers entity status on partnerships, but also provides that partners are individually liable for all partnership obligations. Therefore, this shareholder limited liability emanates mainly from statute.</p>"	lift would time also credit by used choosing are therefore controlled compete sham situation where from nothing right solely competed treated wa likely this he decision be veil employee for were provides former pierce exceptional beneficiary simple piercing company say english that uniform reality personhood contract view similarly liable almost corporate job debt conferred competing up court though partner incurs of just before which deliberately is obligation set but separate cover so appear on sole left signed afforded it his statute do period lifting director law usually owed partnership state entity mainly confers act terminology new a principle long may revised all uphold limited or veila shareholder owned not example breach person and one if make businessman treat individually country noncompeting united the to emanates corporation common despite duty legal technically responsible completely ha with liability status in	Temporary rescission of corporate personhood	personhood corporate rescission of temporary	Companies

Stock certificate	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In corporate law, a <b>stock certificate</b> (also known as <b>certificate of stock</b> or <b>share certificate</b>) is a legal document that certifies ownership of a specific number of shares or stock in a corporation. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to dividends, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect the transfer of the shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the share certificate as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a <b>holding statement</b> in lieu of a share certificate for each parcel of shares owned. </p><p>Most jurisdictions now require corporations to maintain records of ownership or transfers of shareholdings, and do not permit share certificates to be issued to bearer. </p> "	these lieu statement streamline burden most number certificate pay permit time also by entitlement redundant proof required without receipt an holding endorsed point be over for many impose jurisdiction that each produced issued effect provide corporate certifies need been of shareholding payment function is obligation today share now produce on evidence document bearer do some dispensed law stock statutory maintain administrative original at least dividend a no circumstance may record being issue paper or provided scheme shareholder owned not example parcel have and transfer historically registered known relevant the to corporation legal longer ownership rendered back with specific require in	legal document certifying ownership of company shares	ownership document company of share certifying legal	Companies

Apparent authority	"<p>In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and South Africa, <b>apparent authority</b> (also called ""ostensible authority"") relates to the doctrines of the law of agency. It is relevant particularly in corporate law and constitutional law. Apparent authority refers to a situation where a reasonable third party would understand that an agent had authority to act. This means a principal is bound by the agent's actions, even if the agent had no <i>actual</i> authority, whether express or implied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance, which he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the authority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even if actual authority has not been given.</p><p>There must be some act or some knowing omission on the part of the principal—if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the <i>presence</i> of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the termination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority. </p><p>In relation to companies, the apparent authority of directors, officers and agents of the company is normally referred to as ""ostensible authority.""

Audit committee	"<p>An <b>audit committee</b> is a committee of an organisation's board of directors which is responsible for oversight of the financial reporting process, selection of the independent auditor, and receipt of audit results both internal and external. </p><p>In a U.S. publicly traded company, an audit committee is an operating committee of the board of directors charged with oversight of financial reporting and disclosure. Committee members are drawn from members of the company's board of directors, with a Chairperson selected from among the committee members. A qualifying (cf. paragraph ""Composition"" below) audit committee is required for a U.S. publicly traded company to be listed on a stock exchange. Audit committees are typically empowered to acquire the consulting resources and expertise deemed necessary to perform their responsibilities. The role of audit committees continues to evolve as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Many audit committees also have oversight of regulatory compliance and risk management activities. </p><p>Not for profit entities may also have an audit committee. </p><p>Internationally, an audit committee assists a board of directors to fulfil its corporate governance and overseeing responsibilities in relation to an entity’s financial reporting, internal control system, risk management system and internal and external audit functions. Its role is to provide advice and recommendations to the board within the scope of its terms of reference / charter.

Business judgment rule	"<p>The <b>business judgment rule</b> is a case law-derived doctrine in corporations law that courts defer to the business judgment of corporate executives.

The rule exists in some form in most common law countries, including the United States, Canada, England and Wales, and Australia.</p><p>To challenge the actions of a corporation's board of directors, a plaintiff assumes ""the burden of providing evidence that directors, in reaching their challenged decision, breached any one of the triads of their fiduciary duty — good faith, loyalty, or due care"".

Custodian bank	"<p>A <b>custodian bank</b>, or simply <b>custodian</b>, is a specialized financial institution responsible for providing <b>securities services</b>. It safeguards assets of asset managers, insurance companies, hedge funds, and is not engaged in ""traditional"" commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. The role of a custodian in such a case would be to: </p> <ul><li>hold in safekeeping assets/securities such as stocks, bonds, commodities such as precious metals and currency (cash), domestic and foreign</li> <li>arrange settlement of any purchases and sales and deliveries in/out of such securities and currency</li> <li>collect information on and income from such assets (dividends in the case of stocks/equities and coupons (interest payments) in the case of bonds) and administer related tax withholding documents and foreign tax reclamation</li> <li>administer voluntary and involuntary corporate actions on securities held such as stock dividends, stock splits, business combinations (mergers), tender offers, bond calls, etc.</li> <li>provide information on the securities and their issuers such as annual general meetings and related proxies</li> <li>maintain currency/cash bank accounts, effect deposits and withdrawals and manage other cash transactions</li> <li>perform foreign exchange transactions</li> <li>often perform additional services for particular clients such as mutual funds; examples include fund accounting, administration, legal, compliance and tax support services</li></ul><p>Using US definitions, a person who owns street name securities and who is not a member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities. Global securities safekeeping practices vary substantially with markets such as the UK, Australia and South Africa encouraging designated securities accounts in order to permit shareholder identification by companies. </p><p>The definition of ""shareholder"" is generally upheld by corporate law rather than securities law. One role of custodians (which may or may not be enforced by securities regulation) is to facilitate the exercise of share ownership rights, for example and processing dividends and other payments, corporate actions, the proceeds of a stock split or a reverse stock split, the ability to vote in the company's annual general meeting (AGM), information and reports sent from the company and so forth. The extent to which such services are offered are a function of the client agreement together with relevant market rules, regulations and laws. </p><p>Custodian banks are often referred to as <b>global custodians</b> if they safe keep assets for their clients in multiple jurisdictions around the world, using their own local branches or other local custodian banks (""sub-custodian"" or ""agent banks"") with which they contract to be in their ""global network"" in each market to hold accounts for their respective clients. Assets held in such a manner are typically owned by larger institutional firms with a considerable number of investments such as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds and pension funds. </p>"	case investment offer security administer order agreement call number stocksequities more permit multiple would registering issuer purchase africa like by sale become street are upheld additional considerable instead other domestic banking cash role who member lending from involuntary tender reclamation part right trustee financial collect an include referred due this linking account doe point consumerretail perceived enforced be manage processing hold engaged for withholding split etc holder company service arrangement beneficiary jurisdiction manner hedge held currency safe contract related each ability local merely foreign provide proxy effect compliance support typically simply specialized individual corporate still together rule income firm often regulation such information extent however proceeds they larger asset business voluntary uk of generally action commercial which payment function is traditional client keep identification inout but settlement share network rather so insurance precious on own forth particular report south it designated combination institution interest metal reverse around document mutual providing global respective commodity transaction maintain stock law impracticality agent market bank at u manager dividend perform safeguard traded general a their accounting definition owner may encouraging using facilitate currencycash or safekeeping withdrawal shareholder owned not example ultimate person exercise and bond deposit one practice if custodian exchange registered branch chain vote merger registration sent relevant vary the than to servicesusing fund world arrange pension tax institutional substantially agm coupon fiduciary legal only any delivery ownership responsible assetssecurities meeting involves with name offered owns through administration annual in australia subcustodian	organization responsible for safeguarding a firm's or individual's financial assets	for organization individual responsible firm or asset a safeguarding financial	Companies

In his testimony, reprinted in his 1980 book <i>Expanded Universe</i>, Heinlein claimed that four NASA spinoff technologies made the surgery possible, and that they were only a few from a long list of NASA spinoff technologies from space development.</p><p>Since 1976, the NASA Technology Transfer Program has connected NASA resources to private industry, referring to the commercial products as spinoffs. Well-known products that NASA claims as spinoffs include memory foam (originally named temper foam), freeze-dried food, firefighting equipment, emergency ""space blankets"", DustBusters, cochlear implants, LZR Racer swimsuits, and CMOS image sensors. As of 2016, NASA has published over 2,000 other spinoffs in the fields of computer technology, environment and agriculture, health and medicine, public safety, transportation, recreation, and industrial productivity.

Cream	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cream</b> is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators"". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.</p><p>Cream skimmed from milk may be called ""sweet cream"" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and ""cheesy"". In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. </p><p>Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. This is also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1444 Cached time: 20220514121235 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.193 seconds Real time usage: 0.256 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 229/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 5898/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 218/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 8/100 Expensive parser function count: 5/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 5954/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.130/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3071873/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 237.787 1 -total 38.09% 90.583 3 Template:Cite_web 32.21% 76.580 1 Template:Short_description 19.13% 45.500 1 Template:Pagetype 17.77% 42.264 1 Template:Pp-semi 9.01% 21.436 1 Template:Other_uses 6.31% 14.997 2 Template:Main_other 4.89% 11.629 1 Template:SDcat 1.22% 2.907 1 Template:Short_description/lowercasecheck -->"	jersey dried give buffalo us white fed more tangy also by fat from tone grain can grazing carotenoid saturated sour this distinguish dish butterfat industrial pigment be derived several for savoury many partially taste natural composed water production yellowishwhite salty contains form produced plant dense cream grainbased fatcream goat high product fraîche eventually often unhomogenized cheesy sweet grade they accelerated pasture yellow cow of le pellet whey before which lower both is color total homogenization so fermented on milk it culinary cheesemaking origin powder some distant shipment sold skimmed higherfat crème level market cattle particularly a may separator using eat hence or byproduct have depending top and slightly process rise content country the butter to called layer ha dairy name centrifuge in indoors	dairy product	product dairy	Foods

It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk. Salt and food colorings are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter or <i>ghee</i>, which is almost entirely butterfat. </p><p>Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 °C (90 to 95 °F). The density of butter is 911 grams per litre (0.950 lb per US pint). It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white.

Peynir	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cheese</b> is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. </p><p>Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged for. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries. A <b>cheesemonger</b>, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting the cheeses, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening them.</p><p>For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus <i>Mucor miehei</i>, but others have been extracted from various species of the <i>Cynara</i> thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs. </p><p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century.</p>"	lactic family mucor cheese throughout chive most buffalo spice type more distribution century plastic turn used by ripening thistle storing blockshaped fat are specialist lesser juice last allows seller compact bacteria other encased from texture added benefit selling flavor calcium range enzyme protective butterfat currently shelf be including over alternative processing degree for flavoring favorable depends many protein fresher expertise will others when activity dioxide cause pasteurized vegetarian production near aged ingredient produced form acid either depend miehei selecting mixture goat high product style hard mass such liquid 21st packaging valued storage nitrogen they gasflushing fungus cow yellow been bacterial of rind adding brie acidified whey annatto which whether lower aromatic then is keep color addition but rennet soft lowerpriced red on pressed shipping separated milk cost curdling it herb cranberry region comprises origin sugar life similar coagulation vacuum some usually agent exist fermentation vinegar curd market lemon completes mold a their animal casein finished bag long may outer curdled into or carbon wide have cynara and extracted various parmesan cheesemakers smoke thousand although portability wood content coagulate country phosphorus the cheesemonger purchasing receiving than to during especially black available longer how themfor sheep layer specie few ha dairy pepper with garlic solid in diet	yellow or white, creamy or solid food made from the pressed curds of milk	the pressed curd or milk creamy yellow solid food made white from of	Foods

Verjuice	"<p><b>Verjuice</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>VUR</span>-jooss</i>; from Middle French <i>vertjus</i> 'green juice') is a highly acidic juice made by pressing unripe grapes, crab-apples or other sour fruit. Sometimes lemon or sorrel juice, herbs or spices are added to change the flavour. In the Middle Ages, it was widely used all over Western Europe as an ingredient in sauces, as a condiment, or to deglaze preparations. It is still used to some extent in the American South. </p><p>It was once used in many contexts where modern cooks would use either wine or some variety of vinegar, but has become much less widely used as wines and variously flavoured vinegars became more accessible. Nonetheless, it is still used in a number of French dishes as well as recipes from other European and Middle Eastern cuisines, and can be purchased at some gourmet grocery stores. The South Australian cook Maggie Beer has popularised the use of verjuice in her cooking and it is being used increasingly in South Australian restaurants. </p><p>Modern cooks use verjuice most often in salad dressings as the acidic ingredient, when wine is going to be served with the salad. This is because it provides a comparable sour taste component, yet without ""competing with"" (altering the taste of) the wine, the way vinegar or lemon juice would. </p><p>Verjus, called <i>husroum</i> (حصرم) in Arabic, is used extensively in Syrian cuisine. In Syria, much of the production of <i>husroum</i> is still done over the course of several days by female members of land-owning clans—even if many of them live in cities.

Cheese	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cheese</b> is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. </p><p>Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged for. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries. A <b>cheesemonger</b>, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting the cheeses, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening them.</p><p>For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus <i>Mucor miehei</i>, but others have been extracted from various species of the <i>Cynara</i> thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs. </p><p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in the 21st century.</p>"	lactic family mucor cheese throughout chive most buffalo spice type more distribution century plastic turn used by ripening thistle storing blockshaped fat are specialist lesser juice last allows seller compact bacteria other encased from texture added benefit selling flavor calcium range enzyme protective butterfat currently shelf be including over alternative processing degree for flavoring favorable depends many protein fresher expertise will others when activity dioxide cause pasteurized vegetarian production near aged ingredient produced form acid either depend miehei selecting mixture goat high product style hard mass such liquid 21st packaging valued storage nitrogen they gasflushing fungus cow yellow been bacterial of rind adding brie acidified whey annatto which whether lower aromatic then is keep color addition but rennet soft lowerpriced red on pressed shipping separated milk cost curdling it herb cranberry region comprises origin sugar life similar coagulation vacuum some usually agent exist fermentation vinegar curd market lemon completes mold a their animal casein finished bag long may outer curdled into or carbon wide have cynara and extracted various parmesan cheesemakers smoke thousand although portability wood content coagulate country phosphorus the cheesemonger purchasing receiving than to during especially black available longer how themfor sheep layer specie few ha dairy pepper with garlic solid in diet	yellow or white, creamy or solid food made from the pressed curds of milk	the pressed curd or milk creamy yellow solid food made white from of	Foods

Filled milk	<p> <b>Filled milk</b> is any milk, cream, or skim milk that has been reconstituted with fats, usually vegetable oils, from sources other than dairy cows.

Other filled milk products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream, sour cream, whipping cream, and half-and-half substitutes among other dairy products. Coconut oil filled milk became a popular cost-saving product sold throughout the United States in the early 20th century. Coconut oil could be cheaply imported, primarily from the Philippines (at the time under American rule), and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk.

Cream	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Cream</b> is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators"". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.</p><p>Cream skimmed from milk may be called ""sweet cream"" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and ""cheesy"". In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. </p><p>Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. This is also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1444 Cached time: 20220514121235 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.193 seconds Real time usage: 0.256 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 229/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 5898/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 218/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 8/100 Expensive parser function count: 5/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 5954/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.130/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3071873/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 237.787 1 -total 38.09% 90.583 3 Template:Cite_web 32.21% 76.580 1 Template:Short_description 19.13% 45.500 1 Template:Pagetype 17.77% 42.264 1 Template:Pp-semi 9.01% 21.436 1 Template:Other_uses 6.31% 14.997 2 Template:Main_other 4.89% 11.629 1 Template:SDcat 1.22% 2.907 1 Template:Short_description/lowercasecheck -->"	jersey dried give buffalo us white fed more tangy also by fat from tone grain can grazing carotenoid saturated sour this distinguish dish butterfat industrial pigment be derived several for savoury many partially taste natural composed water production yellowishwhite salty contains form produced plant dense cream grainbased fatcream goat high product fraîche eventually often unhomogenized cheesy sweet grade they accelerated pasture yellow cow of le pellet whey before which lower both is color total homogenization so fermented on milk it culinary cheesemaking origin powder some distant shipment sold skimmed higherfat crème level market cattle particularly a may separator using eat hence or byproduct have depending top and slightly process rise content country the butter to called layer ha dairy name centrifuge in indoors	dairy product	product dairy	Foods

Milk	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Milk</b> is a nutrient-rich liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many other nutrients, including protein and lactose. </p><p>The US CDC recommends that children over the age of 12 months should have two servings of dairy milk products a day.</p><p>As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals. In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, but it exports few other milk products. Because there is an ever-increasing demand for dairy products within India, it could eventually become a net importer of dairy products.

Butter	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Butter</b> is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of churned cream. It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature, consisting of approximately 80% butterfat. It is used at room temperature as a spread, melted as a condiment, and used as an ingredient in baking, sauce making, pan frying, and other cooking procedures. </p><p>Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk. Salt and food colorings are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter or <i>ghee</i>, which is almost entirely butterfat. </p><p>Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 °C (90 to 95 °F). The density of butter is 911 grams per litre (0.950 lb per US pint). It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural, unmodified color is dependent on the source animal's feed and genetics, but the commercial manufacturing process sometimes manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto or carotene. </p>"	remains component 80 sometimes consistency most buffalo white clarified refrigerated also like used by spreadable made fat are emulsion 32 globule other from where added condiment can density an butterfat dependent be including per inversion protein churning natural when water litre 911 ingredient nearly cream almost goat sauce salt 95 product firm ghee frying food melt consisting rendering liquid baking pan pale cow entirely yellow generally of commercial which gram manipulates annatto is color but separate cooking produce 0950 mammal pint on milk procedure unmodified it source 90 removing coloring carotene frequently °c semisolid room approximately churned at u temperature softens °f a animal manufacturing deep or and spread waterinoil yak process buttermilk butter the genetics to feed emulsifier varies sheep 35 ha manufactured dairy making thin with melted solid resulting lb in	dairy product made from the fat and protein components of churned cream and is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature	component protein is and made fat cream emulsion the product semisolid from room churned at temperature dairy a of	Foods
Ice cream	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Ice cream</b> is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F).

Custard	<p><b>Custard</b> is a variety of culinary preparations based on sweetened milk, cheese, or cream cooked with egg or egg yolk to thicken it, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. Depending on the recipe, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (<i>crème anglaise</i>) to the thick pastry cream (<i>crème pâtissière</i>) used to fill éclairs. The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla; however, savory custards are also found, e.g., in quiche. </p><p>Custard is usually cooked in a double boiler (bain-marie), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation, because a temperature increase of 3–6 °C (5–10 °F) leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 °C (~175 °F); it begins setting at 70 °C (~160 °F). A water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles. Adding a small amount of cornflour to the egg-sugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard, allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a double-boiler. A sous-vide water bath may be used to precisely control temperature. </p> 	flour 80 control cheese sometimes consistency most 70 cornflour cooker fill setting also used custard are well from quiche can without overcooking include eg be boiler should bainmarie begin single 160 very thick doubleboiler stove allowing cooked water saucepan increase because 3–6 stabilises cream preparation small typically mixture sauce though gently pan sweetened however even generally of adding anglaise gelatin éclairs before precisely vanilla is 175 egg on 5–10 recipe milk fully curdling slows it lead culinary sugar heated °c yolk easier based usually crème heat at temperature steamed °f a may corn found pressure thicken or not variety exceed depending and amount starch savory transfer make double dessert vary the pastry to common sousvide pâtissière operation pouring baked remove oven with thin eggsugar resulting delicate in curdles bath	variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk	on mixture and milk or yolk a culinary cooked of cream based variety preparation egg	Foods
Infant formula	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Infant formula</b>, <b>baby formula</b> or just <b>formula</b> (American English) or <b>baby milk</b>, <b>infant milk</b>, <b>false milk</b>, or <b>first milk</b> (British English), is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as ""a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk"".</p><p>Manufacturers state that the composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mother's milk at approximately one to three months postpartum; however, there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products. The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's milk whey and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.</p><p>A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that infant formula prepared in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their <i>Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding</i>, which restated that ""processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission"", and also warned that ""lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality"". </p><p>In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. A formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with <i>Cronobacter sakazakii</i> and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. Although <i>C. sakazakii</i> can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of <i>E. sakazakii</i> infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.</p>"	manufacturer case component these mix amino human american most partial clean more rarely die between commonly time also used by believed federal processedfood fat are prevalence additional defines complementary deferment group mother other suitable who soybean from dietary young foryoung microorganism britain solely can without wa breastfeeding an likely greatest due ffdca great infection increased 2001 age diarrhea designed be british substitute including distributed formulafed codex should for mixed cosmetic simulation accompanied commission economically pneumonia many protein sakazakii underreported reported feeding when month average cause english water that health 25 safe production ingredient acid place because dozen preparation mortality 2006 prepared illness milkmanufacturers suitability roughly product life—are introduction 1958 food complete such liquid living breast several infant carbohydrate however serious even drug nutrient cow represented been recommended of just three le c restated composition postpartum whey accordance which strategy there both warned is addition pif on four report particular equipment morbidity milk upswing 6 poorer it source lactose introduced false unicef difference e organization risk unsanitary belief powder alimentarius global sold based standard usually approximately linked 12 childhood state death significant purified at u lack act halfyear under a their worldwide casein use breastfed hydrolysed formula breastfeeding—and special using mostly all powdered purport found into or cupfeeding contain have depending and factor vegetable one first meet marketed although 2003 sanitizing oil unclean content country united the bottlefeeding important condition than to child world especially during 3 otherwise developed published outcome ha manufactured 12monthsa baby reason with blend allergic resulting vitaminmineral associated cronobacter in applicable exclusive	manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding of infants	and for infant marketed manufactured food feeding designed of	Foods

During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms ""clots"" or ""clouts"", hence the name. It forms an essential part of a cream tea. </p><p>Although its origin is uncertain, the cream's production is commonly associated with dairy farms in South West England and in particular the counties of Devon and Cornwall. The current largest commercial producer in the United Kingdom is Rodda's at Scorrier, Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25 tons of clotted cream a day. In 1998 the 'Cornish clotted cream' was registered as a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) under European Union law. The designation can be used if the production follows certain requirements, from milk produced in Cornwall and the cream has a minimum fat content of 55%. Upon Brexit, the PDO was also registered under UK law.

Curd	<p><b>Curd</b> is obtained by coagulating milk in a sequential process called curdling. It can be a final dairy product or the first stage in cheesemaking. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or <i>curds</i>. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Curds can be used in baking or may be consumed as a snack. </p> 	lactic cheese producing also used by are juice bacteria added can sour this increased blue be obtained for protein will etc allowing cause pasteurized that raw produced acid contains snack stage product secondary mass style consumed such liquid drained baking tangle substance percent cow been of adding whey final before which then is rennet acidity produce pressed left milk curdling introduced it way finish 90 cheesemaking edible coagulation naturally different aging agent vinegar sequential curd lemon mold coagulating a casein may desired caused into or varying and amount one first process coagulate alone acidic the step to called remaining only any ha dairy with solid in	dairy product	product dairy	Foods

Eric Gill	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Arthur Eric Rowton Gill</b>, (22 February 1882 – 17 November 1940) was an English sculptor, letter cutter, typeface designer, and printmaker. Although the <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i> describes Gill as ″the greatest artist-craftsman of the twentieth century: a letter-cutter and type designer of genius″, he remains a figure of considerable controversy following revelations of his sexual abuse of two of his daughters. </p><p>Gill was born in Brighton and grew up in Chichester, where he attended the local college before moving to London. There he became an apprentice with a firm of ecclesiastical architects and took evening classes in stone masonry and calligraphy. Gill abandoned his architectural training and set up a business cutting memorial inscriptions for buildings and headstones. He also began designing chapter headings and title pages for books. </p><p>As a young man, Gill was a member of the Fabian Society, but later resigned. Initially identifying with the Arts and Crafts Movement by 1907 he was lecturing and campaigning against the movements perceived failings. He became a Roman Catholic in 1913 and remained so for the rest of his life. Gill established a succession of craft communities, each with a chapel at its centre and with an emphasis on manual labour as opposed to more modern industrial methods. The first of these communities was at Ditchling in Sussex where Gill established the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic for Catholic craftsmen. Many members of the Guild, including Gill, were also members of the Third Order of St. Dominic, a lay division of the Dominican Order. At Ditchling Gill, and his assistants, created several notable war memorials including those at Chirk in north Wales and at Trumpington near Cambridge along with numerous works on religious subjects. </p><p>In 1924, the Gill family left Ditchling and moved to an isolated, disused monastery at Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of Wales. The isolation of Capel-y-ffin suited Gill's wish to distance himself from what he regarded as an increasingly secular and industrialised society and his time there proved to be among the most productive of his artistic career. At Capel, Gill made the sculptures <i>The Sleeping Christ</i> (1925), <i>Deposition</i> (1925) and <i>Mankind</i> (1927). He created engravings for a series of books published by the Golden Cockerel Press, considered among the finest of their kind, and it was at Capel that he designed the typefaces Perpetua, Gill Sans and Solus. After four years at Capel, Gill and his family moved into a quadrangle of properties at Speen in Buckinghamshire. From there, in the last decade of his life Gill became an architectural sculptor of some fame, creating large, high profile, works for central London buildings including both the headquarters of the BBC and the forerunner of London Underground. His mammoth frieze, <i>The Creation of Man</i>, was the British Governments' gift to new League of Nations building in Geneva. Despite failing health Gill was active as a sculptor until the last weeks of his life, leaving several works to be completed by his assistants after his death. </p><p>Gill was a prolific writer on religious and social matters, with some 300 printed works including books and pamphlets to his name. He frequently courted controversy with his opposition to industrialisation, modern commerce and the use of machinery in both the home and workplace. In the years preceding World War II, he embraced pacifism and left-wing causes. </p><p>Gill's religious beliefs did not limit his sexual activity, which included several extramarital affairs. His religious views and subject matter contrast with his deviant sexual behaviour, including, as described in his personal diaries, his sexual abuse of his daughters, an incestuous relationship with at least one of his sisters and sexual experiments with his dog. Since these revelations became public in 1989, there have been a number of calls for works by Gill to be removed from public buildings and art collections. </p>"	family attended order chichester frieze industrialised by speen labour quadrangle commerce succession social regarded sculpture man craft perceived productive deviant national wale workplace english oxford near third among page 1907 two up been sussex of league centre architectural abuse monastery career matter pamphlet decade failing frequently november some notable least controversy created use 1882 isolation golden february religious artistic craftsman one engraving campaigning the himself genius″ against home sans initially with heading sexual christ became fabian cutting gift embraced forerunner more book affair society removed 300 last 1925 young from central series wa industrial be roman british born for were many london activity cause dominic bbc later took each local described college 1913 chapter until kind business emphasis year buckinghamshire arthur which machinery set catholic but numerous included cockerel pacifism four it modern sculptor property death a dog ecclesiastical calligraphy creation secular did first work apprentice industrialisation incestuous moving mountain resigned disused preceding relationship in lecturing remains mankind contrast number call type subject memorial extramarital letter isolated moved considerable manual ″the member where sister collection evening press since revelation he designed including st several lay building those biography that stone remained deposition high along identifying printed assistant solus courted there both printmaker on suited perpetua life – capel figure abandoned rest class their art headquarters grew considered gill into not rowton inscription diary leaving although eric masonry despite black active what headstone twentieth name cambridge north mammoth these most behaviour century prolific leftwing capelyffin writer time also typeface made 17 large movement joseph completed describes 1940 greatest an method architect lettercutter dictionary designing limit cutter training following health chapel war view wish ii distance dominican opposition firm profile after 1989 1927 designer trumpington brighton week before 22 so division personal guild left ditchling government belief his creating sleeping increasingly fame community artistcraftsman at new nation experiment title 1924 public began have opposed underground and established to geneva world daughter chirk published finest proved	English sculptor, typeface designer, and printmaker (1882-1940)	and designer 18821940 typeface english printmaker sculptor	Monuments_and_memorials

William Stanford (sculptor)	"<p> <b>William Walter Tyrell Stanford</b> (1839–2 June 1880) was an Australian sculptor. </p><p>Stanford was born in London, England, son of Thomas Tyrell, contractor, and his wife Frances <span title=""Name at birth"">née</span> Trevor. As a youth Stanford was apprenticed to a stonemason. </p><p>Stanford came to Victoria in 1852, probably as a ship's boy, and for a time worked on the gold diggings at Bendigo. In 1854 he was found guilty on a charge of horse-stealing and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at HM Prison Pentridge, near Melbourne. After serving nearly six years, he was released on ticket of leave. On 1 May 1860 Stanford was found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and one of horse-stealing and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Afterward Stanford declared his innocence of two of the charges, and, in the charge of horse-thievery, he said was not the principal actor but assisted a fellow ex-prisoner. Stanford was again imprisoned at Pentridge, to become one of the most insubordinate of all the prisoners and thoroughly hardened. </p><p>The chaplain was impressed Stanford's drawings on a slate and carved bone figure. The carving was shown to Colonel Champ, governor of the prison, who offered Stanford the opportunity to create more art if he promised to improve his behaviour. The chaplain gained permission for Charles Summers to teach Stanford modelling. Later Stanford submitted a design for a fountain which was approved. He only had local bluestone from the prison quarry for construction. Stanford worked for four years on it and became exemplary in his conduct. Summers told his friends about it and many appeals were made for the release of the prisoner. Stanford was ""discharged to freedom by remission"" in October 1871, the fountain was set up in the triangular piece of ground between Parliament House and the treasury building, and there Stanford gave it its finishing touches. It is an excellent piece of design, amazingly successful when the conditions under which it was produced are considered. </p><p>Stanford became a monumental mason at Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne. There he married and was respected and liked by his neighbours. His business was successful and he made a reputation for his carved headstones. One of these may be seen on the main drive of the St Kilda Cemetery not far from the gate. Another example of his work is on his wife's grave at the Melbourne cemetery. Stanford died of ""ulceration of the stomach"" on 2 June 1880 at Prahran, partly from the effects of inhaling the fine dust while working on the fountain. </p>"	née these worked remission respected france most colonel house construction successful released neighbour more behaviour gold had opportunity dust june between grave time gained by made become permission improve are digging charge probably 1854 carved kilda mason melbourne freedom touch apprenticed cemetery who from reputation wa principal an conduct actor he prison ground drawing partly be impressed pentridge born st for robbery were many said building fellow submitted amazingly shown london sentenced release gave when teach told drive bluestone triangular near william later another ten inhaling produced while promised local effect nearly married thomas bendigo bone exemplary appeal after approved two up horsethievery innocence seen contractor trevor boy create business far year of horsestealing stomach six friend afterward modelling which there is ticket 22 carving set but liked discharged on four came imprisoned it 1839–2 charles sculptor assisted 1860 his about piece monumental ship governor figure suburb exprisoner victoria ulceration england finishing at quarry main gate under a tyrell art considered may summer all thoroughly excellent found champ stanford 1 not hardened example guilty chaplain stonemason and one 1880 if work died 2 windsor 1852 imprisonment serving insubordinate prisoner prahran youth the son october treasury condition 1871 to fountain highway slate only again hm wife declared walter headstone parliament leave offered australian fine working became in design	Australian sculptor	australian sculptor	Monuments_and_memorials

Valley of the Fallen	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Valley of the Fallen</b> (Spanish: <b>Valle de los Caídos</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ˈbaʎe ðe los kaˈiðos]</span>)), is a Catholic basilica and a monumental memorial in the municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, erected at Cuelgamuros Valley in the Sierra de Guadarrama, near Madrid. Dictator Francisco Franco claimed that the monument was meant to be a ""national act of atonement"" and reconciliation. It served as the burial place of Franco's remains from his death in November 1975 until his exhumation on 24 October 2019, as a result of efforts to remove all public veneration of his dictatorship, and following a long and controversial legal process. </p><p>The monument, considered a landmark of 20th-century Spanish architecture, was designed by Pedro Muguruza and Diego Méndez on a scale to equal, according to Franco, ""the grandeur of the monuments of old, which defy time and memory."" Together with the <i>Universidad Laboral de Gijón</i>, it is the most prominent example of the original Spanish Neo-Herrerian style, which was intended to form part of a revival of Juan de Herrera's architecture, exemplified by the nearby royal residence El Escorial. This uniquely Spanish architecture was widely used in public buildings of post-war Spain and is rooted in international fascist classicism as exemplified by Albert Speer or Mussolini's Esposizione Universale Roma. </p><p>The monument precinct covers over 3,360 acres (13.6 km<sup>2</sup>) of Mediterranean woodlands and granite boulders on the Sierra de Guadarrama hills, more than 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level and includes a basilica, a Benedictine abbey, a guest house, the Valley, and the <i>Juanelos</i> — four cylindrical monoliths dating from the 16th century. The most prominent feature of the monument is the towering 150-metre-high (500 ft) Christian cross, the tallest such cross in the world, erected over a granite outcrop 150 metres over the basilica esplanade and visible from over 20 miles (32 km) away. Work started in 1940 and took over eighteen years to complete, with the monument being officially inaugurated on 1 April 1959. According to the official ledger, the cost of the construction totalled 1,159 million pesetas, funded through national lottery draws and donations. Some of the labourers were prisoners who traded their labour for a reduction in time served. </p><p>The complex is owned and operated by the Patrimonio Nacional, the Spanish governmental heritage agency, and ranked as the third most visited monument of the Patrimonio Nacional in 2009. The Spanish social democrat government closed the complex to visitors at the end of 2009, citing safety reasons connected to restoration on the façade. The decision was controversial, as the closure was attributed by some people to the Historical Memory Law enacted during José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's premiership, and there were claims that the Benedictine community was being persecuted. The works include the Pietà sculpture prominently featured at the entrance of the crypt, using hammers and heavy machinery. In November 2010, citing safety reasons, the Zapatero government closed down the Basilica for Mass. It was reopened in June 2012. </p> "	rom remains burial above operated spain closed most house lorenzo construction agency more pronunciation old memorial century ˈbaʎe precinct june visited time abbey used by sea monolith 910 franco intended monument 32 served labour madrid cuelgamuros ðe sierra benedictine esplanade visible draw heritage who social closure from towering part 16th 1940 wa km2 includes tallest include sculpture spanish this neoherrerian governmental municipality 150 democrat decision los be francisco caídos architecture result atonement designed national muguruza according over for 136 were 2009 eighteen 1159 building complex royal uniquely josé guest 500 citing revival that following visitor 20thcentury prominent controversial near took méndez meant universidad form place rooted million juanelos dictator third dating persecuted ft gijón christian peseta together laboral style mass complete prominently luis — exhumation hill 150metrehigh such san until started cylindrical 24 inaugurated year of 3000 restoration nacional officially kaˈiðos reconciliation attributed defy boulder which 2019 km valle there mussolini machinery is catholic residence international façade exemplified valley cover on el ranked four effort april cost zapatero it end labourer landmark nearby government monumental his feature official zapateros november 2010 donation some claim classicism veneration law grandeur safety totalled community escorial herreras death original level pietà at erected basilica claimed act woodland traded a mediterranean their funded mile long considered fascist albert juan cross being using all 20 ledger granite or public reopened 1 owned example diego premiership acre and down away 2012 work widely speer enacted process reduction fallen prisoner historical crypt the october foot de than to world featured during entrance guadarrama outcrop patrimonio legal scale equal 1975 dictatorship universale lottery connected postwar pedro m rodríguez heavy people memory remove hammer metre with reason esposizione through 1959 in 3360	monument in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain	el de spain lorenzo in san monument escorial	Monuments_and_memorials

Its construction was planned according to the joint Russian-Finnish agreement about the cooperation in preserving the memory of those who perished in the war, adopted in 1992. The author of the monument is Karelian sculptor Leo Lankinen, who won the contest of the projects. Because of his death, the monument was finished by Karelian sculptor Eduard Akulov, with overall planning of the site carried out by architect Lia Karma, with the help of Finnish landscape experts Seppo Hiekala and Seppo Rosenberg from Kuopio, Finland, where a committee in support of the construction of the monument was established.

Ludlow Massacre	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Ludlow Massacre</b> was a mass killing perpetrated by anti-striker militia during the Colorado Coalfield War. Soldiers from the Colorado National Guard and private guards employed by Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&amp;I) attacked a tent colony of roughly 1,200 striking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado, on April 20, 1914. Approximately 21 people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. John D. Rockefeller Jr., a part-owner of CF&amp;I who had recently appeared before a United States congressional hearing on the strikes, was widely blamed for having orchestrated the massacre.</p><p>The massacre was the seminal event of the 1913–1914 Colorado Coalfield War, which began with a general United Mine Workers of America strike against poor labor conditions in CF&amp;I's southern Colorado coal mines. The strike was organized by miners working for the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company and Victor-American Fuel Company. Ludlow was the deadliest single incident during the Colorado Coalfield War and spurred a ten-day period of heightened violence throughout Colorado. In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, bands of armed miners attacked dozens of anti-union establishments, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 225-mile (362 km) front from Trinidad to Louisville. From the strike's beginning in September 1913 to intervention by federal soldiers under President Woodrow Wilson's orders on April 29, 1914, an estimated 69 to 199 people were killed during the strike. Historian Thomas G. Andrews has called it the ""deadliest strike in the history of the United States.""<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 1"">: 1 </span></sup></p><p>The Ludlow Massacre was a watershed moment in American labor relations. Socialist historian Howard Zinn described it as ""the culminating act of perhaps the most violent struggle between corporate power and laboring men in American history"". Congress responded to public outrage by directing the House Committee on Mines and Mining to investigate the events. Its report, published in 1915, was influential in promoting child labor laws and an eight-hour work day. The Ludlow townsite and the adjacent location of the tent colony, 18 miles (29 km) northwest of Trinidad, Colorado, is now a ghost town. The massacre site is owned by the United Mine Workers of America, which erected a granite monument in memory of those who died that day. The Ludlow tent colony site was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009, and dedicated on June 28, 2009. Subsequent investigations immediately following the massacre and modern archeological efforts largely support some of the strikers' accounts of the event.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1358 Cached time: 20220514121854 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.659 seconds Real time usage: 0.815 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 3428/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 389270/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 153044/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 21/100 Expensive parser function count: 1/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 60562/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.301/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 7800666/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 687.769 1 -total 54.16% 372.503 1 Template:Infobox_civil_conflict 30.19% 207.612 14 Template:Military_navigation 25.80% 177.415 1 Template:Infobox 18.65% 128.241 13 Template:Campaignbox 13.97% 96.079 5 Template:Cite_book 13.53% 93.079 1 Template:Campaignbox_US_Labor_strikes 10.99% 75.563 1 Template:Colorado_coalfield_war 9.97% 68.559 1 Template:Short_description 6.46% 44.416 3 Template:Rp -->"	cfampis family throughout american order most house poor had influential 199 1913–1914 between june partowner history by tent federal 21 monument historic miner estimated front 29 moment subsequent largely who from townsite watershed massacre cfampi guard socialist wa outrage an adjacent archeological account hearing andrew day band beginning including january struggle jr town national destroying several for colony organized were single mine violence retaliation location 2009 militia those intervention mining company blamed establishment spurred 1200 that following deadliest incident war private howard dozen described 1914 rocky support 225mile thomas 1913 tenday roughly corporate 16 congress mass congressional along orchestrated 18 ghost president promoting soldier coal of 362 relation site attacked before appeared which southern km g 28 culminating is massacrethe immediately now antistriker on trinidad effort committee april report america it designated 69 victoramerican modern directing violent rockefeller landmark colorado eighthour iron having event striker period some property law approximately september historian labor 1915 state at erected john act general under ludlow a their power killed mile 20 northwest granite seminal armed responded public investigate 1 owned began and died work widely employed fuel investigation d men engaging united the heightened condition woodrow strike against mountain child worker skirmish to louisville called striking during laboring antiunion coalfield wilson wife published dedicated perpetrated people killing ha zinn memory with perhaps recently working in	attack by Colorado National Guard and mine camp guards on striking coal miners	and on mine by miner coal striking national attack guard colorado camp	Monuments_and_memorials

Saint Joseph's Day	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Saint Joseph's Day</b>, also called the <b>Feast of Saint Joseph</b> or the <b>Solemnity of Saint Joseph</b>, is in Western Christianity the principal feast day of Saint Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary and legal father of Jesus Christ, celebrated on 19 March. It has the rank of a solemnity in the Catholic Church. It is a feast or commemoration in the provinces of the Anglican Communion, and a feast or festival in the Lutheran Church. Saint Joseph's Day is the Patronal Feast day for Poland as well as for Canada, persons named Joseph, Josephine, etc., for religious institutes, schools and parishes bearing his name, and for carpenters. It is also Father's Day in some Catholic countries, mainly Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It is not a holy day of obligation for Catholics in the United States. </p><p>19 March was dedicated to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the 10th century, and this custom was established in Rome by 1479. Pope Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution <i>Quo primum</i> (14 July 1570). Originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept, it was re-raised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost, and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class (now called a solemnity), having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept. Since 1969, Episcopal Conferences may, if they wish, transfer it to a date outside Lent. Even if it occurs inside Lent on the usual date of 19 March, it is still observed as a Solemnity of a Saint—this is one of the few times during Lent the Gloria may be said or sung, the vesture is changed from the purple or violet of Lent to white or gold (as it would be for such a solemnity normally), the Collect and the Eucharistic Prayer's Preface and other prayers are from the Solemnity and not Lent, the hymns are more joyful, and the Creed is said. However, the Alleluia is still not used, the Tract being used instead, per Lenten regulations.</p><p>Between 1870 and 1955, an additional feast was celebrated in honor of Saint Joseph as Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Patron of the Universal Church, the latter title having been given to him by Pope Pius IX. Originally celebrated on the third Sunday after Easter with an octave, after <i>Divino Afflatu</i> of Saint Pius X (see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X), it was moved to the preceding Wednesday (because Wednesday was the day of the week specifically dedicated to St. Joseph, St. John the Baptist and local patrons). The feast was also retitled The Solemnity of Saint Joseph. This celebration and its accompanying octave were abolished during the modernisation and simplification of rubrics under Pope Pius XII in 1955. </p><p>At the same time, Pope Pius XII established an additional Feast of ""St. Joseph the Worker"", to be celebrated on 1 May, in order to coincide with the celebration of International Workers' Day (May Day) in many countries. Until this time, 1 May had been the Feast of the Apostles Saint Philip and James, but that Feast was then moved to the next free day, 11 May (and again to 3 May, in 1969, having become free in the meantime). In the new calendar published in 1969, the Feast of Saint Joseph The Worker, which at one time occupied the highest possible rank in the Church calendar, was reduced to an optional Memorial, the lowest rank for a saint's day.</p><p>The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Joseph on the Sunday after Christmas.</p><p>Popular customs among Christians of various liturgical traditions observing Saint Joseph's Day are attending Mass or the Divine Service, wearing red-coloured clothing, carrying dried fava beans that have been blessed, and assembling home altars dedicated to Saint Joseph.</p>"	lent v july normally intermittently dried observed spain 1570 tract order free rubric white accompanying highest more gold century had memorial would clothing liturgical time also used by reraised 1479 tradition become 1955 afflatu moved are breviary reduced 19 precept church rome xii additional latter parish instead well other bearing primum joseph from consequently christmaspopular wa principal collect an possible abolished this anglican since daythe next day universal same wednesday solemnity be roman sung st vesture specifically several honor for celebrates fava per were joyful many said etc divino service hymn current assembling that canada custom divine carrying school retitled celebration third episcopal because given local wish among raised occupied james christian reform still 1870 mass after such optional patronal apostolic until quo eucharistic changed however they lenten lutheran saint—this even father been apostle lowest of pope spouse wearing lost entire week carpenter which 1917 occurs him see is then obligation catholic blessed but 14 various international now on creed portugal coincide modernisation observing commemoration x it rite originally outside eastern redcoloured having his inside simplification usual some ix date class state named husband at march mainly 10th john 1969 11 new general holy a communion extended under virgin use may status mary orthodox festival meantime all being conference title or western gloria poland baptist 1 not have person preface bean christianity and religious celebrated constitution first saint if transfer one alleluia octave attending established purple regulationsbetween calendar double jesus rank second country pius united the josephine violet altar to worker called remaining patron sunday italy common during philip home feast legal 3 again dedicated published preceding prayer ha few province with name easter christ institute in	Catholic festival to remember Joseph, husband of Mary	festival husband to remember catholic joseph of mary	Monuments_and_memorials

Tribute album	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>album</b> is a collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at <span role=""math"">33<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>3</span></span> rpm. </p><p>The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the compact cassette during the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s, sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. </p><p>Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or ""mixed"" together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed ""live"", even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some ""live rooms"", have reverberation, which creates a ""live"" sound. Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track. </p><p>Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. Historically, the term ""album"" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later, collections of related 78-rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78-rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an ""album""; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.</p> "	audio housed mix minute sometimes 8track nineteenth most headphone sharply had distribution digital century played early between word time also short used by book term sale medium are music libretto resembling additional compact other 78rpm largely from overdubbing part popularity wa without collection an hour can live this editing be assist including built several hold single for mixed were location etc concert collected usage when disappeared declined that recording item eliminating voice could later another each related form while issued place supplanted effect minidisc reached individual 331⁄3 still alongside together take liner after such information though 21st until printed adjustment they late bundled even photograph applied year of song recorded mixing which booklike then is era sound focused analysis separate cover consumption technology on rpm cd mid1960s 1980s creates bound mp3 introduced it modern side 1983 tape decade evolved track piece about period some out different room venue usually studio requires at frame 1990s done extended a listening phased record cassette peak may being mostly using into or provided gradually lyric contain separately have and various longplaying first one 1970s widely note historically 1948 although process known disc absorb the brought 1965 musical 21stcentury artist to album lp called during home expression only developed varies 20th completely 35 few format with vinyl dominant termed in field 2000s reverberation	collection of audio recordings	collection recording audio of	Monuments_and_memorials

Transcription (music)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In music, <b>transcription</b> is the practice of notating a piece or a sound which was previously unnotated and/or unpopular as a written music, for example, a jazz improvisation or a video game soundtrack. When a musician is tasked with creating sheet music from a recording and they write down the notes that make up the piece in music notation, it is said that they created a <i>musical transcription</i> of that recording. Transcription may also mean rewriting a piece of music, either solo or ensemble, for another instrument or other instruments than which it was originally intended. The Beethoven Symphonies transcribed for solo piano by Franz Liszt are an example. Transcription in this sense is sometimes called <i>arrangement</i>, although strictly speaking transcriptions are faithful adaptations, whereas arrangements change significant aspects of the original piece. </p><p>Further examples of music transcription include ethnomusicological notation of oral traditions of folk music, such as Béla Bartók's and Ralph Vaughan Williams' collections of the national folk music of Hungary and England respectively. The French composer Olivier Messiaen transcribed birdsong in the wild, and incorporated it into many of his compositions, for example his <i>Catalogue d'oiseaux</i> for solo piano. Transcription of this nature involves scale degree recognition and harmonic analysis, both of which the transcriber will need relative or perfect pitch to perform. </p><p>In popular music and rock, there are two forms of transcription. Individual performers copy a note-for-note guitar solo or other melodic line. As well, music publishers transcribe entire recordings of guitar solos and bass lines and sell the sheet music in bound books. Music publishers also publish PVG (piano/vocal/guitar) transcriptions of popular music, where the melody line is transcribed, and then the accompaniment on the recording is arranged as a piano part. The guitar aspect of the PVG label is achieved through guitar chords written above the melody. Lyrics are also included below the melody. </p>"	wild above sometimes rock performer chord sheet also by book incorporated tradition hungary adaptation transcribe catalogue are music intended write other guitar well messiaen from where part aspect ethnomusicological wa popular collection an pianovocalguitar include melody this andor french national nature for degree notation arranged many said will change when franz arrangement that recording transcribed sense copy another form ralph either notating written respectively game tasked individual notefornote publisher faithful need such two up bartóks musician they below achieved pitch doiseaux of beethoven label entire video composition rewriting which piano there both birdsong is then accompaniment sound analysis on included bound oral sell béla it originally solo line piece his creating unpopular strictly england original symphony significant perform williams further a created transcriber mean may jazz into or lyric example and down harmonic practice pvg make note although instrument previously ensemble perfect whereas the musical than to called liszt relative publish scale unnotated soundtrack bass melodic composer olivier transcription vaughan folk with speaking involves recognition through in improvisation	adaptation of a musical composition to a medium for which it didn't initially write	composition for initially write musical which to didnt it adaptation a medium of	Monuments_and_memorials

Burial in Anglo-Saxon England	<p> <b>Burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England</b> refers to the grave and burial customs followed by the Anglo-Saxons between the mid 5th and 11th centuries CE in Early Mediaeval England. The variation of the practice performed by the Anglo-Saxon peoples during this period, included the use of both cremation and inhumation. There is a commonality in the burial places between the rich and poor - their resting places sit alongside one another in shared cemeteries. Both of these forms of burial were typically accompanied by grave goods, which included food, jewelry, and weaponry. The actual burials themselves, whether of cremated or inhumed remains, were placed in a variety of sites, including in cemeteries, burial mounds or, more rarely, in ship burials. </p><p>Within the areas of Anglo-Saxon settlement, there was both regional and temporal variation while burial practices. The early Anglo-Saxons were followers of a pagan religion, which is reflected in their burials from this time, while they later converted to Christianity in the seventh and eighth centuries CE, which was again reflected in their burial practices, when cremation ceased to be practised and inhumation became the sole form of burial, typically being concentrated in Christian cemeteries located adjacent to churches. </p><p>In the eighteenth century, antiquarians took an interest in these burials, and began excavating them, although more scientific excavation only began in the twentieth century with the development of archaeology. Prominent Anglo-Saxon burials that have since been discovered and excavated include the early cemetery of Spong Hill in Norfolk and the great sixth-seventh century ship burial of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. </p>	concentrated suffolk remains these burial eighteenth rich sixthseventh poor more rarely variation century converted located grave early between mound time by church follower cemetery from shared performed wa an include adjacent development this since great be including area were accompanied 5th excavation when that custom prominent ce another later took form while place spong mediaeval typically religion archaeology christian cremated alongside antiquarian food them hill they temporal inhumed been jewelry 11th of hoo inhumation themselves site which sutton whether there both is eighth seventh settlement included anglosaxon sole ceased good interest excavating reflected ship period norfolk england pagan anglosaxons a their sit use placed practised being discovered within or scientific variety began have and christianity practice one excavated although weaponry cremation actual the to during resting only again people regional twentieth with mid commonality followed became in refers	details of Anglo-Saxon burials in England	england anglosaxon burial of in detail	Monuments_and_memorials

Catacombs of Rome	"<p>The <b>Catacombs of Rome</b> (Italian: <i lang=""it"">Catacombe di Roma</i>) are ancient catacombs, underground burial places in and around Rome, of which there are at least forty, some rediscovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together, Jews and also adherents of a variety of pagan Roman religions were buried in catacombs, beginning in the 2nd century AD, occasioned by the ancient Roman ban on burials within a city, and also as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land. The most extensive and perhaps the best known is the Christian Catacomb of Callixtus located near the Park of the Caffarella, but there are other sites, both Christian and not, scattered around the city, some of which are now engulfed in the modern urban sprawl. </p><p>The Christian catacombs are extremely important for the history of Early Christian art, as they contain the great majority of examples from before about 400 AD, in fresco and sculpture, as well as gold glass medallions (these, like most bodies, have been removed).

Funerary art	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Funerary art</b> is any work of art forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the dead. The term encompasses a wide variety of forms, including cenotaphs (""empty tombs""), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains, and communal memorials to the dead, such as war memorials, which may or may not contain remains, and a range of prehistoric megalithic constructs. Funerary art may serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centred practices of ancestor veneration or as a publicly directed dynastic display. It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living. </p><p>The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures – Hindu culture, which has little, is a notable exception. Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures – from the Egyptian pyramids and the Tutankhamun treasure, to the Terracotta Army surrounding the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Sutton Hoo ship burial and the Taj Mahal – are tombs or objects found in and around them. In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions. </p><p>An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies. The treasure of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators. A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians. In these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted sarcophagus and tomb monument of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The mausoleum intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in Islamic culture. </p>"	exterior remains these burial human most encompasses instance treasure type memorial grave between deposited also by object term tradition ordinary are kinshipcentred preventing intention monument intended past celebrate visible other role benevolence demonstration from bestknown funeral part cultural can wa an never range include development prehistoric accomplishment repository publicly effective be including roman megalithic for visiting many highly those simple serve visitor viewing war later play dead maintaining form produced while admitted lavish nearly directed almost construct mortality specialized forming except christian classical culture spirit ancestor after east such living them army though mausoleum shi communal flourished seen help unwelcome possession tomb exception hoo of might which article whether function sutton is tutankhamun tomblike hindu pharaoh division empty good mahal it rite reminder intrusion display life – around similar value ship do afterlife qin humankind asian apparent notable veneration usually funerary at least cenotaph completion creator egyptian a their exceptionally power use art placed may sarcophagus sculpted all found surrounding into or public limited creation not example dynastic variety wide contain have islamic and artistic deposit practice factor ceremony work wealthy custodian although aesthetic greek huang the important grandest to permanent world pyramid common propitiate dynasty expression any powerful again connected empire terracotta what people ha halicarnassus little with taj grand in 18th	grave art	grave art	Monuments_and_memorials

Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel	<p>Rock-cut tombs were a form of burial and interment chamber used in ancient Israel. Cut into the landscapes surrounding ancient Judean cities, their design ranges from single chambered, with simple square or rectangular layouts, to multi-chambered with more complex designs. Almost all burial chambers contain a platform for primary burial and an ossuary or other receptacle for secondary burial. There is debate on if these tombs were originally intended for secondary burials, or if that practice arose later.</p><p>The use of rock-cut cave tombs in the region began in the early Canaanite period, from 3100–2900 BCE. The custom lapsed a millennium, however, before re-emerging in the earliest Israelite tombs, dating to the 9th century BCE in Jerusalem. The use of rock-cut tombs reached its peak in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE, before rapidly declining and eventually falling out of use in the 6th century BCE in some regions.</p><p>Use of the tombs has been recorded as recently as the late Roman period around the 3rd century CE.</p><p>The use of such tombs was generally reserved for the middle- and upper-classes, and each typically belonged to a single nuclear or extended family.</p>	lapsed these burial family reserved israelite more century debate early square used intended interment other from arose wa an range landscape layout roman single for were complex rectangular simple declining that custom chamber belonged each form nuclear cut dating rapidly almost typically millennium multichambered reached 3rd upperclasses secondary eventually laterthe such earliest however city late cethe tomb been generally of recorded bce cave before receptacle israel there middle is 3100–2900 on it region canaanite originally jerusalem around period some out reemerging 8th ossuary 6th extended a their use primary peak chambered 9th 7th all surrounding into or ancient contain began and practice if falling the rockcut to judean regionsuse ha with platform recently in design	aspect of history	history aspect of	Monuments_and_memorials

It mainly dates back to around 3000 to 2400 BC, although the earliest tombs at the site date back to 4100 to 3800 BC. The caves collapsed sometime before 2000 BC, and the site was later used for domestic and agricultural purposes.</p><p>After being discovered in the late 18th century, the site was excavated in the 1820s before being reburied and forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1964, and major excavations took place between 1987 and 1994. It is the only prehistoric stone-enclosed hypogeum in Europe, and it is regarded as one of the most important archaeological sites in Malta along with the megalithic temples and the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni.

Alan García	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p><b>Alan Gabriel Ludwig García Pérez</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ˈalaŋ ɡaβˈɾjel luðˈwiɣ ɡaɾˈsi.a ˈpeɾes]</span>; 23 May 1949 – 17 April 2019) was a Peruvian politician who served as President of Peru for two non-consecutive terms from 1985 to 1990 and from 2006 to 2011. He was the second leader of the Peruvian Aprista Party and to date the only party member ever to have served as President. Mentored by the founder of the APRA, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, he served in the Constituent Assembly of 1978–1979. Elected to the Peruvian Congress in 1980, he rose to the position of General Secretary of the APRA in 1982, and was subsequently elected to the presidency in 1985 in a landslide victory at the age of 35 years. </p><p>García's first presidential term was marked by a severe economic crisis, social unrest and violence. At the conclusion of his first presidency, he was accused and investigated for corruption and illicit enrichment. In 1992, he filed for asylum following president Alberto Fujimori's self-coup, and exiled himself with his family in Colombia and France for the next nine years. In the aftermath of Fujimori's downfall, he made a surprising political comeback as he ran for the presidency in 2001, although he lost in the second round to Alejandro Toledo. In 2006, he was elected to the presidency for a second term, a feat considered an unexpected political resurrection based on the negative legacy of his first term.</p><p>Throughout Garcia's second term, Peru experienced a steady economy, becoming the fastest growing country in Latin America in 2008, surpassing China in terms of rising GDP. The economic success of his presidency would be acclaimed as a triumph by world leaders, and poverty was reduced from 48% to 28% nationally. In addition, Peru signed free trade agreements with the United States and China during García's presidency, but accusations of corruption would persist throughout his term and beyond. He was succeeded by his former 2006 run-off rival Ollanta Humala in 2011. He withdrew from party politics after failing to advance to the second round of the 2016 general election, placing fifth in his bid for a record third presidential term under the Popular Alliance coalition between his party and the Christian People's Party, which included former rival Lourdes Flores as one of his running mates.</p><p>On 17 April 2019, García died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head as police officers under a prosecutor's orders were preparing to arrest him over matters relating to the Odebrecht scandal. He was transferred to a hospital in serious condition, where he remained for more than three hours in an operating room, during which he suffered three cardiorespiratory arrests before his death.</p><p>García is considered one of the most controversial yet talented politicians of Peru's contemporary history.

Bashar al-Assad	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Bashar Hafez al-Assad</b> (born 11 September 1965) is a Syrian politician who is the 19th president of Syria, since 17 July 2000. In addition, he is the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and the Secretary-General of the Central Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. His father, Hafez al-Assad, was the president of Syria before him, serving from 1971 to 2000. </p><p>Born and raised in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the Syrian Army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital in London, specialising in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel died in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian military presence in Lebanon in 1998. </p><p>Political scientists have characterised the Assad family's rule of Syria as a personalist dictatorship. On 17 July 2000, Assad became president, succeeding his father, who died in office a month prior. In the uncontested 2000 and 2007 elections, he received 97.29% and 97.6% support, respectively. On 16 July 2014, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after another election gave him 88.7% of the vote. The election was held only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country's ongoing civil war and was criticised by the UN. Assad was re-elected in 2021 with over 95% of the vote in another non-democratic national election. Throughout his leadership, human rights groups have characterized Syria's human rights situation as poor. The Assad government describes itself as secular, while some political scientists write that his regime exploits sectarian tensions in the country.</p><p>Once seen by many states as a potential reformer, the United States, the European Union, and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad's resignation from the presidency in 2011 after he ordered a violent crackdown on Arab Spring protesters, which led to the Syrian civil war. In December 2013, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated that findings from an inquiry by the United Nations implicated Assad in war crimes. The OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism concluded in October 2017 that Assad's government was responsible for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. In June 2014, the American Syrian Accountability Project included Assad on a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels it sent to the International Criminal Court. Assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the American-led intervention in Syria for attempting regime change.</p>"	protester december july family human reformer uncontested 2014 attended throughout resignation american 2017 poor attack criticised alassad june sevenyear party regime office by heir crash term itself presidency 17 charge syrian controlled crime joint write group university civil chemical rejected role who situation from central arab damascus describes specialising nondemocratic socialist wa right tension spring an since union he presence elder born over area national 1998 for many lebanon project bassels london intervention change countryonce brother month gave 2021 that held potential war hafez school later another while car postgraduate assad 2007 support respectively rebel raised high 95 16 rule take after leadership medical army court indictment president un seen 976 concluded force shaykhun characterized father year sworn of hospital eye baath 2000 doctor received league led stated finding before which accountability him ongoing is addition pillay americanled international on included four list commissioner syria commanderinchief secretarygeneral 9729 scientist exploit it political violent government personalist 887 19th his official some 2011 criminal apparent characterised entered prior september state european at 11 1988 nation a taking assads opcwun graduated reelected academy armed bashar western attempting secular began have 2013 and majority died work recalled inquiry sectarian serving vote sent country united the october navi 1965 politician to election called khan during mechanism ordered allegation only dictatorship command succeeding implicated responsible bassel 1994 ha study ophthalmology with military 1971 became in crackdown investigative	President of Syria	syria president of	Politicians

The leader of the PAIS Alliance political movement from its foundation until 2017, Correa is a democratic socialist and his administration focused on the implementation of left-wing policies. Internationally, he served as president <i>pro tempore</i> of the UNASUR. </p><p>Born to a lower middle-class mestizo family in Guayaquil, Correa studied economics at the Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, the University of Louvain (UCLouvain), and the University of Illinois, where he received his PhD. Returning to Ecuador, in 2005 he became the Minister for the Economy under President Alfredo Palacio, successfully lobbying Congress for increased spending on health and education projects. </p><p>Correa won the presidency in the 2006 general election on a platform criticizing the established political elites. Taking office in January 2007, he sought to move away from Ecuador's neoliberal economic model by reducing the influence of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. He oversaw the introduction of a new constitution, being re-elected in 2009 and again in the 2013 general election. </p><p>Correa's presidency was part of the Latin American pink tide, a turn toward leftist governments in the region, allying himself with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela and bringing Ecuador into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas in June 2009. Using its own form of 21st century socialism, Correa's administration increased government spending, reducing poverty, raising the minimum wage and increasing the standard of living in Ecuador. Between 2006 and 2016, poverty decreased from 36.7% to 22.5% and annual per capita GDP growth was 1.5 percent (as compared to 0.6 percent over the prior two decades). At the same time, inequalities, as measured by the Gini coefficient, decreased from 0.55 to 0.47. By the end of Correa's tenure, the halving of the price of oil since 2014 had caused Ecuador's economy to enter a recession, resulting in government spending being slashed.</p><p>On 3 July 2018, a judge in Ecuador ordered a warrant for the arrest of Correa after he failed to appear in court during a trial surrounding the kidnapping of his political opponent Fernando Balda. Correa, who lived in Belgium at the time, denied the allegations regarding the kidnapping. In July 2018 Interpol rejected an Ecuador-issued arrest warrant and called it ""obviously a political matter."" In April 2020 the Criminal Court of the National Court of Justice found the former president guilty of aggravated passive bribery in the es:Caso Sobornos 2012-2016.

Originally a socialist and left-wing nationalist, he is considered to have shifted towards neoliberal policies and the political centre during his presidency.</p><p>Born to a prominent political family affiliated with the ethnocacerist movement, Humala is the son of famed Quechua labour lawyer Isaac Humala. Humala entered the Peruvian Army in 1981, eventually achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. During his time in the military, he fought in the internal conflict against far-left terrorist group Shining Path as well as in the Cenepa War with neighboring Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etat against President Alberto Fujimori during the dying days of his regime; eventually, Congress granted him amnesty and Humala was allowed to return to military duty.</p><p>In 2005, Humala entered electoral politics, founding the Peruvian Nationalist Party (PNP) in order to run in the 2006 presidential election. Having received first place in the first round, he faced former centre-left President and APRA candidate Alan García in the second round, ultimately losing by a narrow margin. His campaign received widespread international attention in 2006 given the recent success of left-wing politicians in Latin America. In 2011, he would once again run for President, and narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori in the runoff. </p><p>Humala's election initially concerned investors, who feared he would govern similar to leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a former ally of his. To assuage these fears, Humala would begin his term by choosing centrists for positions in his cabinet. Humala's unpopular presidency was dominated by corruption scandals surrounding him and his politically influential wife Nadine Heredia. Environmentalists were highly critical of Humala's mining policies, and argued that he reneged on his campaign promise to rein in mining companies.</p><p>In 2017, Humala was arrested by Peruvian authorities on corruption charges.

In the 1953 election the United Party under Strauss lost seven seats, while their opponents the National Party gained twenty-five more seats and a majority in Parliament. Following this election, the United Party suffered two splits, creating the Liberal Party and the Union Federal Party. </p><p>In 1954, a further split resulted in the National Conservative Party. In 1956, while plagued by ill health and convalescing in England, he asked his party to decide whether they wished to keep him on as leader. They declined to do so: the first time the leader of a South African political party had been forcibly removed. Strauss was succeeded as United Party leader by De Villiers Graaff. </p><p>As opposition leader, Strauss accepted political and social segregation of races but opposed the National Party government's disregard for the rule of law and its removal of ""Coloured"" voters from the electoral rolls which had been entrenched in the South African constitution but arbitrarily removed by the apartheid government. </p>"	december 1990 1900 1943 leader more had graaff party time gained by asked federal convalescing 1956 minister seven removed 17 1953 resulted conservative who social from wa this earlier union he cabinet seat national for split defeat declined following health voter j n while suffered removal coloured agriculture gideon opposition rule two 1950 until they twentyfive been of strauss lost roll decide 7 segregation apartheid g which whether opponent him 1954 keep but accepted so on villiers nel arbitrarily south it disregard political jan ill government – his creating plagued do law entrenched forcibly england march succeeded further under a their or smut jacobus liberal opposed and majority constitution first 1948 wished known united the de race politician to election electoral african koos parliament in kosie	South African politician	politician south african	Politicians
Rifaat Eid	"<p><b>Rifaat Ali Eid</b> (Arabic: <span lang=""ar"" dir=""rtl"">رفعت علي عيد</span>; born 24 February 1977) is the leader of the Arab Democratic Party as of 25 December 2015. The party has the largest support of Lebanese Alawites, and its base is Tripoli, Lebanon, in the Jabal Mohsen neighbourhood. Rifaat took over its leadership after his father, former MP Ali Eid, died in 2015. </p><p>He led the party through the Bab Al-Tabbaneh-Jabal Mohsen clashes that have repeatedly happened from 2008 onwards, and has supported inhabitants of Jabal Mohsen financially when they could not go to work because of armed conflicts. During the 2008 Lebanon conflict, where Sunnis and Shias fought throughout Lebanon, Rifaat said in an interview, ""We're the most convenient targets, the stand-in for Hezbollah, our problem can only be solved when the Shiites and Sunnis solve theirs."" He stated that Alawites in Tripoli do not have problems with Sunnis, but have to protect themselves when they are attacked. He also stated, ""The Salafis are like kittens when they are weak, but when they are strong they become like tigers.""</p><p>During the 2011-2012 Syrian Uprising, he accused anti-Syrian groups in Lebanon, such as the Future Movement, of funding and equipping Islamists in Tripoli. He believes the Alawites in Lebanon are attacked in revenge for events in Syria, and that the Syrian army can protect Lebanese Alawites against attacks from armed Islamists, since the Lebanese army is ineffective against them.</p><p>On 10 April 2014, an indictment had demanded the death penalty for Rifaat Eid and three senior Jabal Mohsen fighters. Eid's pro-Damascus Arab Democratic Party, the main faction in Jabal Mohsen, participated in more than 20 rounds of deadly sectarian fighting with gunmen from the neighboring Bab al-Tabbaneh district between 2008 and 2014.

Party leader	"<p>In a governmental system, a <b>party leader</b> acts as the official representative of their political party, either to a legislature or to the electorate. Depending on the country, the individual colloquially referred to as the ""leader"" of a political party may officially be party chair, secretary, or the highest political office. </p><p>The party leader is often responsible for managing the party's relationship with the general public and leading the competition against political rivals, similar to the role of a party spokesperson. As such, they will take a leading role in developing and communicating party platforms to the electorate. </p><p>In many representative democracies, party leaders compete directly for high political office. It is thus typical in such states (notably in the Westminster system) for the party leader to seek election to the legislature and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's parliamentary leader. In several countries utilizing the parliamentary system, if the party leader's political party emerges with a majority of seats in parliament after a general election, is the leading party in a coalition government, or (in some instances) is the largest party in a minority parliament, that party's leader often serves as the prime minister. This is much harder to do in presidential and semi-presidential systems, where the chief executive is a president who can only be removed by a special impeachment (typically involving a legislative supermajority, an investigation by a constitutional court, or both), and removal entails either a snap election or automatic succession to office by a Vice president; therefore, the party's internal leader either takes a background role (such as the Chairs of the Democratic, and Republican parties in the United States), or the leadership may be automatically bestowed on a sitting President who belongs to the party (such as the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan). In countries using the Westminster system, the leader of the largest political party not within the government serves as the leader of the opposition. </p>"	instance leader bestowed highest westminster supermajority elected party office by democracy minister removed coalition therefore competition communicating succession background compete role who where minority legislative can involving an referred this governmental leading executive be seat harder vice several for much many will serve seek that managing parliamentary prime either removal semipresidential democratic rival serf typically high individual opposition take often after leadership such chair court president entail they constitutional of thus officially impeachment both is taiwan on chief it political representative government emerges internal similar official secretary do some progressive automatic state automatically act general a their may colloquially special using spokesperson simultaneously within or public legislature not utilizing depending and largest electorate notably majority if directly investigation developing sitting system country united the republican against presidential to election typical only belongs responsible relationship parliament with platform snap in	leading official of a political party	party official leading a political of	Politicians

List of places named after Robert Byrd	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>United States Senator Robert Byrd (November 20, 1917 – June 28, 2010) represented the U.S. state of West Virginia as a Democrat in the United States Senate. During his tenure as chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, Byrd secured billions of dollars of Federal funds for projects throughout West Virginia, many of which bear his name. Byrd served four terms as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee: January 3, 1989 through January 3, 1995; January 3, 2001 through January 20, 2001; June 6, 2001 through January 3, 2003; and January 3, 2007, through January 3, 2009. As a New Deal Democrat, Byrd used his position as chairman to battle persistent poverty in his home state of West Virginia, which he referred to as “one of the rock bottomest of states.” ""I lost no opportunity to promote funding for programs and projects of benefit to the people back home,"" said Byrd.“ Within two years of his chairmanship, Byrd surpassed his announced five-year goal of making sure more than $1 billion in Federal funds was sent back to West Virginia. In referring to his economic contributions to West Virginia, Byrd said in 2000, ""West Virginia has always had four friends: God Almighty, Sears Roebuck, Carter's Liver Pills and Robert C. Byrd.""</p><p>Byrd's steering of billions of Federal dollars to West Virginia earned him the sobriquets ""King of Pork"" by the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization Citizens Against Government Waste and ""Prince of Pork"" from other taxpayer groups. According to Citizens Against Government Waste, Byrd was the first legislator to bring $1 billion of ""pork"" spending to his home state. The group named Byrd its initial ""Porker of the Year"" in 2002.</p><p>In addition to providing Federal funding to special projects, Byrd also ensured that many Federal complexes were built in West Virginia, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg, the United States Coast Guard's National Maritime Center in Kearneysville, and a training center and firing range for U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers near Harpers Ferry. Clarksburg's FBI facility was the first of the major Federal complexes to be built under Byrd's leadership as chairman of the appropriations committee. In West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, Byrd helped bring ten federal facilities that employed more than 3,200 people. None of these facilities are named for him, however.</p> <p>More than 50 buildings built with funds from US taxpayers directed to West Virginia are named for either Byrd or his wife, Erma Ora Byrd (née James). Several transportation projects named for Byrd have gained national notoriety, including the Robert C. Byrd Highway. Also known as ""Corridor H"" of the Appalachian Development Highway System, the highway was dubbed ""West Virginia's road to nowhere"" in 2009 after it received a $9.5 million earmark in the $410 billion Omnibus Appropriations Act. The highway received another $21 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Critics argued the traffic on the highway was too light and the cost too high for the project to continue construction until its proposed completion in 2035. The State of West Virginia argued the highway was necessary as ""an ideal evacuation route for Washington, about 100 miles away, in case of an emergency.""</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1402 Cached time: 20220514122621 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.314 seconds Real time usage: 0.375 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 624/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 17010/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 425/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 12/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 16409/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.194/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 4804705/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 338.104 1 -total 34.88% 117.931 1 Template:Cite_news 19.39% 65.560 1 Template:Short_description 16.77% 56.711 7 Template:Cite_web 12.49% 42.214 1 Template:Pp-pc1 9.91% 33.497 1 Template:Pagetype 5.76% 19.479 1 Template:Use_mdy_dates 4.58% 15.497 3 Template:Main_other 3.69% 12.463 1 Template:SDcat 3.62% 12.234 1 Template:DMCA -->"	case i harper bottomest née these erma fbi h throughout american rock pork protection construction more had opportunity june also used by ensured gained firing steering ideal term federal deal announced road are always 21 taxpayer served group none facility other porker maritime 501c3 panhandle from secured earned guard roebuck benefit wa king an “ 2035 range referred border development democrat carter he 2001 byrdbyrds recovery too be january almighty according including built national os for 2009 several were notoriety complex many said building economic project sure kearneysville training sears major service sobriquet that custom near another ten million either billion 2007 directed dubbed light james bureau 95 corridor high contribution funding appalachian leadership robert after route omnibus two 3200 1989 information until however fiveyear dollar appropriation clarksburg ferry earmark represented argued year of received 1995 lost 2000 c continue 100 friend transportation proposed which 1917 traffic 28 him senate evacuation liver critic addition bring ” officer west nowhere on division four committee bear cost 6 prince it government eastern organization senator – his god about 2010 november promote criminal providing coast washington state named 410 u goal completion act new under reinvestment a no legislator mile spending special 20 nonprofit battle within waste or poverty 50 1 emergency pill have and center 2002in away one first employed investigation surpassed 2003 known justice sent system united the against than to position chairman fund referring highway tenure during home necessary 3 virginia wife persistent citizen program people ha chairmanship making back with byrd name helped through in initial	Wikimedia list article	list article wikimedia	Politicians

Bill Clinton	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>William Jefferson Clinton</b> (né <b>Blythe III</b>; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton became known as a New Democrat, as many of his policies reflected a centrist ""Third Way"" political philosophy. He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election. </p><p>Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and he later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation. </p><p>Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. </p><p>Clinton's second term would be dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal which began in 1996, when he began a sexual relationship with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines. The scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached after Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around Clinton using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and that he lied under oath. In 1999 Clinton's impeachment trial begin in the Senate. Clinton was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, the conviction threshold. </p><p>Clinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault against him have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1317 Cached time: 20220514120551 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.860 seconds Real time usage: 0.981 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 10791/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 55908/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 13910/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 20/100 Expensive parser function count: 6/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 11972/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.427/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 7502021/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 936.416 1 -total 62.37% 584.036 1 Template:Infobox_officeholder 27.10% 253.751 17 Template:Infobox_officeholder/office 14.69% 137.572 1 Template:Birth_date_and_age 10.38% 97.166 1 Template:Cite_news 9.22% 86.383 1 Template:Marriage 5.92% 55.479 1 Template:Pp-semi-blp 5.42% 50.772 1 Template:Redirect 4.68% 43.835 1 Template:Short_description 4.51% 42.238 7 Template:Main_other -->"	december haiti h 2008 attended white care 40 old elected party perot history by term ruth presidency charge 19 jointhighest w group warming returned scholarship generation roosevelt democrat impeached national envoy nafta much when jefferson oxford aid third surplus among association tabloid alongside 2016 congress east two obstruct assault been of responsibility tier franklin article is hivaids conviction warsaw representative humanitarian passed reagan law saddam politics created special ross using reelected 1993 win unified longest 46 investigation intern campaigning previously system the nominee against during becoming ordered dayton centered wife oath scandal with military sexual george advocating became met throughout american free more boomer affair foundation full 1977 last crime europe ideological thirdyoungest from 1946 wa surplus—the august news andrew be born for 1998 stephen were formed many pact reported cause involved school later deregulation trial advance scrutiny college still eventually upper comfortably kosovo johnson year participated which culminating but international insurance independent way political modern né iii reflected secretary governor period rhodes liberation address u 1969 act mid1990s a power signing expansion first work known vote 42nd second historical politician fund pas failed oslo 1992 1975 nonconsecutive program relationship hussein baby iraq followed in control plan rating agreement subject would budget office joined northern 1996 peacetime defeating nato clinton domestic attorney member acquitted conduct since centrist he 2001 january over begin 2009 former lewinsky economic earthquake gave that remained william foreign democratic incumbent 22yearold reform appointed rodham presided president however they received bader impeachment both him era on signed dominated 1983 saw violent around 2010 global campaign camp state named accord threshold under graduated into york leaving supreme escalated businessman trade starting presidential election peace called graduating monica 1999 bosnian allegation measure evolution active education 67 ha study ireland north house i 1979 prevention opportunity time also cast approval made hillary won served georgetown conservative university breyer who financial an ronald yale substantial intervention childrens health 1981 war summit married raised congressional after such court bush three israeli–palestinian middle senate lied personal ranked ranking left eastern assisted senator his husband at new general nation policy public ginsburg enforcement began overhauled have philosophy 2013 and blythe d process sign headline united republican to chairman arkansas david again any 1994 speaking	42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001	the state president to 2001 1993 from of 42nd united	Politicians
Political career of John C. Breckinridge	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The political career of John C. Breckinridge included service in the state government of Kentucky, the Federal government of the United States, as well as the government of the Confederate States of America. In 1857, 36 years old, he was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States under James Buchanan. He remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of Southern Democrats, but lost the election to the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln. </p><p>A member of the Breckinridge political family, John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, he was the first Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican–American War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration. </p><p>In 1859, the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to a U.S. Senate term that would begin in 1861. In the 1860 United States presidential election, Breckinridge captured the electoral votes of most of the Southern states, but finished a distant second among four candidates. Lincoln's election as President prompted the secession of the Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the Civil War, he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the Confederate States Army, and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Confederate States Secretary of War. Then, concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture on May 10, 1865 effectively ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to Cuba, then Great Britain, and finally Canada, remaining in exile until President Andrew Johnson's offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875. </p>"	dissident remains ended offer family resume worked most exile concluding douglas old would 1865 elected encouraged joined office by term federal won 1854 served group civil returned breckinridge well represent district complication county member fight territory surrender mexican–american from returning right britain wa popular strict 1875 candidate great democrat union he andrew kentucky beginning youngest over vice davis abraham hold considering for national stephen begin unlikely 1857 champion confederacy service when cause that canada jefferson war private later capture refused related form reelection among democratic futilely kansas–nebraska james hopeless cuba nominated appointed addressing sovereignty congressional injury after prompted though lincoln army until president subsequently inaugurated amnesty effectively johnson year of reunite lost c fled 1851 southern him senate then constructionism peacefully but ran 1868 resource included on four career sympathized fearing america convention political fired representative captured government ever expelled life 1860 his secretary 1859 distant influence arrest finally state 8th at u john secession sided act supported under general a administration allocating finished 1856 mean may request acquired in 20 all 10 february fort person opposed and practice died first slavery although sumter vote second 36 united the republican 1861 october negotiate presidential to election electoral remaining fayette legal assembly confederate little with enjoyed became house buchanan	professional biography	professional biography	Politicians
Political career of Rab Butler (1929–1941)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Richard Austen Butler</b> (9 December 1902 – 8 March 1982), generally known as <b>R. A. Butler</b> and familiarly known from his initials as <b>Rab</b>, was a prominent British Conservative politician. </p><p>Butler was elected to Parliament for Saffron Walden in Essex at the 1929 general election, and soon became a parliamentary assistant to Samuel Hoare, the leading Conservative politician associated with Indian policy. Butler attended the Second Round Table Conference and early in 1932 he visited India on Lord Lothian's Franchise Committee, which recommended an increase in the Indian franchise. Butler became the youngest member of the government, aged 29, in September 1932 when he was appointed Under-Secretary for India. In this position he helped to steer the Government of India Act 1935, which granted provincial self-government to India, through the Commons, in the teeth of strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who spoke for much rank-and-file Conservative opinion in the country. Between May 1937 and February 1938 Butler served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour. </p><p>In February 1938 Butler was moved to be Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, serving under Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Butler, who was often the main Government foreign affairs spokesman in the Commons, was a strong supporter of the appeasement of Nazi Germany. He supported Chamberlain's efforts to negotiate with Adolf Hitler in September 1938, culminating in the Munich Agreement, and after Hitler broke the agreement by occupying Prague in March 1939 Butler continued to urge rapprochement with Germany and – up to the very outbreak of war – to oppose Britain going to war for the sake of Poland. After the outbreak of war he continued to hanker towards a compromise peace, and in June 1940 he had a mysterious meeting with the Swedish trade envoy Björn Prytz, at which he declared that British attitude to peace would be based on ""common sense not bravado"". Thereafter he retained his job at the Foreign Office until May 1941 but appears to have been kept away from serious decision-making. </p><p>Butler's later claims in his memoirs (1971), that he had supported appeasement merely to gain time for rearmament, are not supported by contemporary evidence.

Alec Douglas-Home	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel</b>, (<span> <span>(<span><span><span></span>listen</span></span>)</span></span>; 2 July 1903 – 9 October 1995) was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1964. He was the only British prime minister born during the Edwardian era, and the last to hold office while a member of the House of Lords, before disclaiming his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two periods serving as Britain's foreign minister than on his brief premiership. </p><p>A talented cricketer, he played first-class cricket at club and county level; he began serving in the Territorial Army from 1924. Douglas-Home (under the courtesy title <b>Lord Dunglass</b>) entered Parliament in 1931 and served as Neville Chamberlain's parliamentary aide, although his diagnosis in 1940 with spinal tuberculosis would immobilise him for two years. Having recovered enough to resume his political career, Douglas-Home lost his seat to Labour at the 1945 general election. He regained it in 1950, but left the Commons the following year when, on the death of his father, he entered the Lords as the <b>14th Earl of Home</b>. Under the next Conservative government, Home was appointed to increasingly senior posts, such as Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post (1960–1963) he supported United States resolve in the Cuban Missile Crisis and was a signatory of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. </p><p>In October 1963, Harold Macmillan resigned as prime minister and Douglas-Home was chosen to succeed him. By the 1960s, it was unacceptable for a prime minister to sit in the House of Lords, so Home disclaimed his hereditary peerage and successfully stood for election to Parliament as <b>Sir Alec Douglas-Home</b>. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two Macmillan Cabinet ministers refused to stay in office under him. Criticised by the Labour Party as an out-of-touch aristocrat, he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with Labour leader Harold Wilson. As prime minister, Douglas-Home's demeanour and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor, Reginald Maudling, free rein to handle financial affairs. He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy and his foreign secretary, Rab Butler, was not especially energetic, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. The Conservative Party, having governed for nearly twelve years, lost its standing after the scandalous Profumo affair under Macmillan and, by Douglas-Home's premiership, seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat; his premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance in 1964. </p><p>Narrowly defeated in the 1964 general election, Douglas-Home resigned the party leadership in July 1965, having instituted a new and less secretive method for electing the leader. He later served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Edward Heath at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1970–1974), an expanded version of his former secretaryship. After the first of the twin Conservative defeats of 1974, he stood down at the second, the October 1974 election, and returned to the Lords as a life peer titled <b>Baron Home of the Hirsel</b>. He gradually retired from front-line politics and died in 1995, aged 92. </p>"	resume july contrast free house secretive leader partial courtesy more criticised recovered century played short would 1970–1974 party office by interview affair stiffly resale minister last aristocrat served labour instituted kingdom narrowly conservative latter succeed returned version county member cricketer firstclass from heath 1940 britain enough wa baron financial an edward august hirsel new he next understanding dealing alec day method 14th british over seat born cabinet hold for rein were former earl defeat demeanour major gradually when crisis tuberculosis manner outoftouch gave following test twin dunglass enjoyed controversial remained later club refused prime parliamentary while douglashome nuclear maudling aged cuban disclaimed foreign among nearly aide listen brief frontline appointed rab electing after leadership such two harold army up oldfashioned 1950 however appointment energetic remainder father year of expanded le 1995 lost 1945 senior unacceptable before abolition post stood there him handle hereditary 1963 alexander era but 1903 neville titled so on career came left it diagnosis political seemed government sir twelve life – his having secretary period governed increasingly 92 passed profumo entered rest frederick standing maintenance briefest level death state cricket at television signatory 1931 politics supported disclaiming under general a resolve taking ban macmillan sit no stay headed scandalous chosen issue commonwealth 1964 title regained 1924 policy peerage missile treaty immobilise or economics not premiership 1974 began and primitive down douglashomes retired first died 2 although 9 appearance serving aristocratic secretaryship second defeated united the 1960s october lasting 1965 chamberlain than to election 1960–1963 spinal electoral common during especially home lord resigned only edwardian wilson legislation reginald heavy parliament successfully butler twentieth with chancellor talented peer price territorial in reputation	former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1903-1995)	the kingdom former prime minister of 19031995 united	Politicians

Between the death of his father, in 1851, and the death of his grandfather, the 4th Earl of Rosebery, in 1868, he was known by the courtesy title of <b>Lord Dalmeny</b>. </p><p>Rosebery first came to national attention in 1879 by sponsoring the successful Midlothian campaign of William Ewart Gladstone. He briefly was in charge of Scottish affairs. His most successful performance in office came as chairman of the London County Council in 1889. He entered the cabinet in 1885 and served twice as foreign minister, paying special attention to French and German affairs. He succeeded Gladstone as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party in 1894; the Liberals lost the 1895 election. He resigned the party leadership in 1896 and never again held political office. </p><p>Rosebery was widely known as a brilliant orator, an outstanding sportsman and marksman, a writer and historian, connoisseur and collector.

In 1807, he resigned as foreign secretary to protest against King George III's uncompromising rejection of Catholic Emancipation.

He held several senior ministerial posts during this time, most notably those of Viceroy of India from 1926 to 1931 and of Foreign Secretary between 1938 and 1940. He was one of the architects of the policy of appeasement of Adolf Hitler in 1936–1938, working closely with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. However, after Kristallnacht (on 9–10 November 1938) and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 he was one of those who pushed for a new policy of attempting to deter further German aggression by promising to go to war to defend Poland. </p><p>On Chamberlain's resignation early in May 1940, Halifax effectively declined the position of Prime Minister as he felt that Winston Churchill would be a more suitable war leader (Halifax's membership in the House of Lords was given as the official reason). A few weeks later, with the Allies facing apparently catastrophic defeat and British forces falling back to Dunkirk, Halifax favoured approaching Italy to see if acceptable peace terms could be negotiated.

Olimpia Poznań	"<p><b>Olimpia Poznań</b> is a Polish multi-sport club from Poznań. It has athletics, archery, basketball, boxing, kendo, judo, swimming, tennis, and triathlon sections. The sections are formally independent of each other, sharing the history and name only. The football section, once a top-flight team for many years folded in 2005. </p><p>The club still is a large sports complex surrounded by Lake Rusałka, a large city recreation area: a Tennis Park where the Poznań Open is held; mountain biking facilities including a four-cross track; an athletics stadium (capacity 3000); and a speedway-football stadium (capacity 20 000), which fell into vast disrepair until it was acquired by the city council from the police in 2013 and was renovated. The football-speedway stadium hosts speedway club PSŻ Poznań, rugby union side NKR Chaos, American football team the Poznań Patriots, and football team Poznaniak Poznań. </p><p>The club initially was owned by the civic military police, and therefore for many years the club was considered one of the ""Gwardian"" clubs. For this reason the club was poorly supported compared to the other professional teams in the city, Warta and Lech. </p><p>In the late 80s and 90s the football section was a regular Ekstraklasa team. </p><p>After the fall of communism the club lost its government backing and the club's fortunes started to drastically decline. The club's individual sections became separate entities due to financial issues, several sections were shut down. The club's facilities became outdated and many of them became abandoned and severely under-repaired. The club remained in the hands of the police force, which after 1989 was called Policja (as opposed to Milicja); the police however severely neglected the club and its facilities, as did the management of the club causing all the sections to close one by one, with the surviving ones only doing so through acting independently of and separating themselves from the parent club. </p><p>In 1995 the football section of <b>Olimpia Poznań</b> was moved from Poznań and merged with Lechia Gdańsk in 1995 creating Olimpia-Lechia Gdańsk. The Olimpia-Lechia Gdańsk merger lasted only one season before both clubs were separate entities again. For Lechia they were already in the third division by 1997. The club tried to rescue its fall through another merger with local club Polonia Gdańsk and changing its name to Lechia-Polonia Gdańsk, with Antoni Ptak's company as the main sponsor. In 2001 Lechia decided to leave the merger, and started as an independent club from the bottom of the football pyramid as the sole legal and spiritual continuation of BKS Lechia, which folded the merged club in 2002. Polonia also had to restart from the bottom of the footballing pyramid after they set up an independent club from the merger in 1999. </p><p>After the 1995 merger, the reserve football team became the senior side, which then played in the IV liga. However the stadium fell into the disrepair, the club's finances were mismanaged and the club fell into obscurity, as well as allegations of corruption and involvement of organised crime groups in its structures. </p><p>Finally in 2005 the football section was dissolved, however the judo and tennis sections which has long severed its police ties have thrived. The basketball teams, in particular the women's side has some success and support in recent years, due to lack of competition in the sport of other clubs, however the basketball section too fell into obscurity. The football-speedway stadium was restored mostly thanks to the efforts of speedway fans and activists of PSŻ Poznań, supported by several other sports. </p>"	80 poorly athletics topflight rugby american nkr sport civic had reserve played fell renovated boxing also history folded by surviving fortune decided fan moved kendo are sharing therefore severed crime drastically success neglected large ptaks competition group lech facility other well tie activist merged from where open mismanaged structure wa financial an doing due this union policja 2001 too footballing including continuation area several chaos for olimpialechia swimming were separating acting complex many tennis park lechia 2002 recent finance company hand backing bk iv held basketball remained 1997 another club each third dissolved local restart 000 support polish judo individual rescue still antoni after biking them organised 1989 close up until severely underrepaired started thrived however they city late archery force gdańsk compared year lechiapolonia section of 3000 1995 lost themselves polonia senior before which both then is vast set already separate so liga division football decline speedway effort independent sole particular warta lake shut it side 90 2005 milicja causing government tried track patriot woman creating fall abandoned some surrounded involvement corruption finally psż entity lack main supported sponsor a long considered stadium spiritual once acquired poznaniak host triathlon 20 disrepair issue all mostly into formally management thanks owned rusałka have 2013 opposed and down outdated did one professional fourcross gwardian ekstraklasa capacity merger footballspeedway communism bottom the police council multisport mountain to called pyramid team season 1999 allegation restored legal obscurity only again lasted initially poznań recreation parent ha speedwayfootball with name reason leave military regular olimpia through became in independently changing	Polish multi-sport club from Poznań	poznań multisport club from polish	Sports_teams

Green Bay Packers	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Green Bay Packers</b> are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919, and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since 1957. </p><p>The Packers are the last of the ""small town teams"" which were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s. Founded in 1919 by Earl ""Curly"" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team. Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America, <i>Forbes</i> ranked the Packers as the world's 27th most valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63 billion.</p><p>The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967 and were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) prior to the AFL–NFL merger. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is named after the Packers' coach Vince Lombardi, who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two subsequent Super Bowl wins came in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy. Additionally, the Packers have recorded the most wins (804) and the highest win–loss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games. The Packers are long-standing adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL's NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played over 100 games against each of those teams through history, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys.

Tham Luang cave rescue	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In June and July 2018, a junior association football team was rescued from the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand. Twelve members of the team, aged eleven to sixteen, and their 25-year-old assistant coach entered the cave on 23 June after a football practice session. Shortly afterwards, heavy rainfall partially flooded the cave system, blocking their way out and trapping them deep within. </p><p>Efforts to locate the group were hampered by rising water levels and strong currents, and no contact was made for nearly two weeks. The cave rescue effort expanded into a massive operation amid intense worldwide public interest and involving international rescue teams. On 2 July, after advancing through narrow passages and muddy waters, British divers John Volanthen and Richard Stanton found the group alive on an elevated rock about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the cave mouth. Rescue organisers discussed various options for extracting the group, including whether to teach them basic underwater diving skills to enable their early rescue, to wait until a new entrance to the cave was found or drilled, or to wait for the floodwaters to subside by the end of the monsoon season months later. After days of pumping water from the cave system and a respite from rain, the rescue teams hastened to get the group out of the cave before the next monsoon rain, which was expected to bring additional downpours and was predicted to start around 11 July. </p><p>Between 8 and 10 July, all twelve of the boys and their coach were rescued from the cave by an international team.</p><p>The rescue effort involved more than 10,000 people, including more than 100 divers, scores of rescue workers, representatives from about 100 governmental agencies, 900 police officers, and 2,000 soldiers. Ten police helicopters, seven ambulances, more than 700 diving cylinders, and the pumping of more than a billion litres of water from the caves were required. </p><p>Saman Kunan, a 37-year-old former Royal Thai Navy SEAL, died of asphyxiation during an attempted rescue on 6 July while returning to a staging base in the cave after delivering diving cylinders to the trapped group.

Laff-A-Lympics	"<p><i><b>Laff-A-Lympics</b></i> is an American animated comedy television series produced by Hanna-Barbera. The series premiered as part of the Saturday-morning cartoon program block <i>Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics</i>, on ABC in 1977. The show is a spoof of the Olympics and the ABC primetime series <i>Battle of the Network Stars</i>, which debuted one year earlier. It featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters organized into teams (the Scooby Doobies, the Yogi Yahooeys, and the Really Rottens) which competed each week for gold, silver, and bronze medals. One season of 16 episodes was produced in 1977–78, and eight new episodes combined with reruns for the 1978–79 season as <i>Scooby's All-Stars</i>. Unlike most cartoon series produced by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, <i>Laff-A-Lympics</i> did not contain a laugh track. <i>Scooby’s Laff-a-Lympics</i> was originally owned by Taft Broadcasting, Warner Bros. Television Distribution currently owns the series through its two in-name-only units, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment and Turner Entertainment. </p><p>The ""all-star"" cast was mostly made up of characters from other Hanna-Barbera series. The ""Scooby Doobies"" included characters from <i>Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</i>, <i>Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels</i>, <i>Speed Buggy</i> and <i>Dynomutt, Dog Wonder</i>; the ""Yogi Yahooeys"" had characters from <i>The Yogi Bear Show</i>, <i>The Huckleberry Hound Show</i> and <i>The Quick Draw McGraw Show</i>. The only original characters were some members of the Really Rottens.</p><p>In 1978, Hanna-Barbera produced another ""all-star"" show with a similar theme: the out-of-this-world competition <i>Yogi's Space Race</i>.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1357 Cached time: 20220514122848 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.339 seconds Real time usage: 0.424 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1238/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 24394/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 2875/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 22/100 Expensive parser function count: 0/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 6514/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.204/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3833763/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 393.779 1 -total 49.71% 195.752 1 Template:Infobox_television 45.15% 177.786 1 Template:Infobox 26.46% 104.200 2 Template:Cite_book 18.84% 74.196 1 Template:Short_description 9.70% 38.202 1 Template:Pagetype 7.01% 27.600 7 Template:Main_other 6.90% 27.178 8 Template:Unbulleted_list 6.73% 26.501 10 Template:If_empty 5.12% 20.161 6 Template:Pluralize_from_text -->"	family captain american most unlike rottens gold distribution had cast by debuted made 1977 abc are caveman competition innameonly 1977–78 primetime unit other draw outofthisworld member from where part series competed wa an earlier 1978 currently you organized for were mcgraw taft another yahooeys each produced yogi s 16 olympics allstar rerun two saturdaymorning silver up laffalympics year of scoobys week character which bronze star is doobies laugh warner premiered network on included rottensin animated bear it really episode originally 45 track similar theme space 1978–79 some broadcasting angel speed hannabarbera wonder original television ’ new medal a dog quick hound mostly comedy battle into owned not buggy contain entertainment block and did cartoon teen one 1970s scoobydoo scooby allstars combined the spoof huckleberry race team featured season dynomutt bros eight show only program with owns through in turner	television series	television series	Sports_teams

Viz (comics)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Viz</b></i> is a British adult comic magazine founded in 1979 by Chris Donald. It parodies British comics of the post-war period, notably <i>The Beano</i> and <i>The Dandy</i>, but with extensive profanity, toilet humour, black comedy, surreal humour and generally sexual or violent storylines. It also sends up tabloid newspapers, with mockeries of articles and letters pages. It features parody competitions and advertisements for overpriced 'limited edition' tat, as well as obsessions with half-forgotten kitsch celebrities from the 1960s to the 1980s, such as Shakin' Stevens and Rodney Bewes. Occasionally, it satirises current affairs and politicians, but it has no particular political standpoint. </p><p>Its success in the early 1990s led to the appearance of numerous rivals copying the format <i>Viz</i> pioneered; none of them managed to attain its popularity. Circulation peaked at 1.2 million in the early 1990s, making it the third-most popular magazine in the UK, but ABC-audited sales have since dropped, to an average of 48,588 per issue in 2018.

List of defunct and relocated National Hockey League teams	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional men's ice hockey league, founded in 1917. The NHL Board of Governors review and approve the relocation of any member club. Each team appoints an individual or individuals to represent their team on the Board of Governors. A majority vote is needed for relocation of a club. Clubs are considered permanently relocated when moved out of their respective home territories, which includes the city that they were located in, plus 50 miles from the city's corporate limits.</p><p>Under the constitution of the NHL, membership is on a partnership basis, each partner holding a franchise from the League for the operation of a hockey club in its designated city. The franchise can out-live teams located in different cities. For example, the Kansas City Scouts, Colorado Rockies, and New Jersey Devils are one franchise. A franchise's history includes the records of competition won in different cities, as differently-named teams. Naming and team logos and designs are registered with the league. Two current teams use the names of previous franchises – the Ottawa Senators and Winnipeg Jets. These franchises do not include the history of the previous franchises, but have used the original franchises' logos and jersey designs. The league considers the history of the current Ottawa Senators to not include the original Senators; the Jets' franchise history includes the Atlanta Thrashers' history, not the first Winnipeg Jets (now the Arizona Coyotes). </p><p>There are 19 defunct and relocated NHL teams. The Montreal Wanderers, original Ottawa Senators, and the Quebec Bulldogs had played in the NHA before joining the NHL; Quebec City joined the NHL two years later as the Athletics. The Pittsburgh Pirates played in the U.S. Amateur Hockey Association as the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets before joining the NHL in 1925. The first NHL team to disband was the Montreal Wanderers, citing the lack of available players due to World War I. The first team to relocate was the Athletics, who relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Tigers. The NHL president at the time, Frank Calder, stripped the franchise from owner Mike Quinn and sold it to a Hamilton-based company. Three franchises became defunct due to the Great Depression: the Philadelphia Quakers, the St. Louis Eagles, and the Montreal Maroons. During their time in the NHL, the Senators and Maroons both won the Stanley Cup championship multiple times, with four and two respectively. The Brooklyn Americans was the last team to become defunct in the NHL. The franchise was struggling financially and, due to the lack of players because of World War II, was suspended prior to the 1942–43 season. The franchise formally ceased in 1946. The Americans' departure reduced the number of teams to six. This began what became known as the Original Six era of the NHL. </p><p>The Original Six era ended when the NHL expanded twofold in 1967. Two teams from the expansion—the California Golden Seals and the Minnesota North Stars—relocated to other cities. The Golden Seals moved to Cleveland after nine seasons in the San Francisco Bay Area to become the Cleveland Barons; this was the first time in four decades the NHL approved a franchise relocation. Two years later, after failed overtures towards merging with the Washington Capitals and the Vancouver Canucks, the Barons merged with the North Stars. The Barons are the only NHL team to merge operations with another one. The North Stars relocated to Dallas in 1993 to become the Stars.</p><p>After six additional expansion teams, the merger of the Cleveland Barons with the Minnesota North Stars, and the NHL–WHA merger, the league had expanded to 21 teams by 1979. Three of the four teams from the NHL–WHA merger relocated to other cities: the Quebec Nordiques, the original Winnipeg Jets, and the Hartford Whalers. The Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, while the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014, with the Hartford Whalers moving to North Carolina and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The Winnipeg Jets identity was revived in 2011, when a Winnipeg-based company received approval from the league to purchase the struggling Atlanta Thrashers and relocate them to Winnipeg for the 2011–12 season. Out of the seven active relocated franchises in the NHL, two have not yet won the Stanley Cup championship: the Coyotes and the Jets (both teams have also never been to the Stanley Cup Finals).</p><p>Most of the metropolitan areas that have hosted relocated or defunct teams have been given another NHL team. Montreal, Quebec City and Atlanta all have two defunct or relocated teams with the Wanderers and Maroons, the Athletics and Nordiques, and the Flames and Thrashers, respectively. Philadelphia (Philadelphia Flyers), Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Penguins), and St. Louis (St. Louis Blues) gained teams during the 1967 expansion. After losing the Americans, two more teams have been added into the New York metropolitan area: the New York Islanders in 1972 and the New Jersey Devils in 1982.

List of defunct and relocated Major League Baseball teams	<p> Throughout the history of Major League Baseball, numerous franchises have moved or become defunct. Many of these franchises played in the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), the two existing major leagues, but other franchises played in one of the eleven major leagues that ultimately went defunct. The classification of the major leagues is based on Major League Baseball's recognition of historical leagues. </p><p>Major league baseball emerged in the 1870s, and four major leagues, including the NL, played at least one season of baseball in the nineteenth century. During this period, dozens of franchises were founded, but most went defunct, leaving just twelve NL franchises by the 1892 season. After four of the twelve NL franchises went defunct following the 1899 season, the American League emerged in 1901 with several newly founded franchises. The Federal League (FL) challenged the primacy of the American League and the National League for two seasons, but the FL and all of its franchises went defunct after the 1915 season. Numerous Negro leagues operated during the first half of the twentieth century; seven leagues that operated from 1920 to 1948 were later recognized as major leagues by Major League Baseball. </p><p>Outside of the Negro leagues, no major league franchises relocated for several years after 1915, until the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee following the 1952 season. Several teams relocated over the next twenty years, often moving to the Western or Southern United States.

The club claims to be a successor of Kyiv Arsenal factory team which traces its history back to 1925. The original factory team used to compete in the Soviet Class B (later reorganized as Soviet Second League), but was relegated in 1964 and officially dissolved (lost professional status). </p><p>The football club of the Ukrainian post-Soviet period was created in 1993 and brought to Kyiv from Boryspil by a geological company Geoton which was one of main sponsors of the Football Federation of Ukraine and Ukraine national football team in the beginning. In 1995–2001 through a merger, the club was reconstituted by the Ministry of Defense as a separate government enterprise not part of the Central Sports Club of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. During that period (1995–2001) it competed in the Ukrainian Top League under CSKA Kyiv brand as its senior (main) squad, while the original army squad continued to compete in lower leagues. In 1995 it was relocated to Kyiv playing at CSK ZSU Stadium and carried such names CSKA-Borysfen and CSKA, while the original FC CSKA Kyiv competing in lower leagues changed its name to CSKA-2 as its reserve squad. Due to difficulty of financing, the ownership of senior squad was transferred to the Kyiv city authorities during the winter break of 2001–02 as part of Oleksandr Omelchenko political project and the newly acquired squad was renamed as Arsenal in memory of the factory team. </p><p>Between 2002 and 2008, Arsenal was a municipal club of Kyiv city and played its games at the Olympiyskiy National Sports Complex. Later when the club was sold to the Ukrainian politician Vadym Rabinovych who promised to build own stadium for the club within the Kyiv city limits, but instead came up with a campaign to revive the history of another Arsenal Kyiv, a factory team of Kyiv Arsenal, which was dissolved in 1960s and consider the current Arsenal Kyiv a phoenix club of its predecessor.

Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Wimbledon Football Club relocated to Milton Keynes in September 2003, 16 months after receiving permission to do so from the Football Association on the basis of a two-to-one decision in favour by an FA-appointed independent commission. The move took the team from south London, where it had been based since its foundation in 1889, to Milton Keynes, a new town in Buckinghamshire, about 56 miles (90 km) to the northwest of the club's traditional home district Wimbledon. Hugely controversial, the move's authorisation prompted disaffected Wimbledon supporters to form AFC Wimbledon, a new club, in June 2002. The relocated team played home matches in Milton Keynes under the Wimbledon name from September 2003 until June 2004, when following the end of the 2003–04 season it renamed itself Milton Keynes Dons F.C. (MK Dons). </p><p>Wimbledon F.C. spent most of its history in non-League football before being elected to the Football League in 1977. A series of club owners believed that its long-term potential was limited by its home ground at Plough Lane, which never changed significantly from the team's non-League days. Meanwhile, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation envisaged a stadium in the town hosting top-flight football and was keen on the idea of an established League team relocating there. The Wimbledon chairman Ron Noades briefly explored moving Wimbledon to Milton Keynes in 1979, but decided it would not lead to larger crowds. Charlton Athletic briefly mooted a relocation in 1973, and in the 1980s the Milton Keynes Development Corporation offered a new ground to Luton Town, who almost became ""MK Hatters"". </p><p>Wimbledon rose through the professional divisions unusually rapidly in what has been called a ""fairytale"". By 1986, they had reached the First Division, the top-flight of English football. In 1991, after the Taylor Report ordered the redevelopment of English football grounds, the team entered a groundshare at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park stadium, about 6 miles (9.7 km) east of Plough Lane. This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while the Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam sought a new stadium site in south-west London, but this search proved frustratingly long, both for Hammam and the club's fans. Much to the anger of most Wimbledon supporters, Hammam proposed new locations for the team outside London, including the Irish capital Dublin. He sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, in 1997 and the following year sold Plough Lane for a supermarket redevelopment. </p><p>Starting in 1997 a consortium led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium, and offered this site to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended to relocate to Milton Keynes. Koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business. After the League refused permission, Koppel launched an appeal, leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently the appointment of a three-man independent commission by the FA in May 2002 to make a final and binding verdict. The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one. The vast majority of the team's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest. Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards. In June 2003 the club went into administration; Winkelman's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, where the team played its first match in September 2003. Winkelman's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name, badge and colours. The team's new ground, Stadium MK, opened three years later. MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C.'s heritage and history, but officially renounced this in 2007. AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015, which they eventually moved into ahead of the 2020–21 season.</p>"	selhurst played elected history by believed decided fan group explored longterm hearing leading ground basis town temporary national much said when search english hockey controversial while kjell association almost hosting 16 appeal east two dublin been of stated retail league led site km vast switched wimbledon 6 hammam 56 irish keynes norwegian do sold charlton significantly paid winkelmans 2003–04 claimed may being threeman northwest one 2003 the receiving barnet home ordered renovation initially bjørn twotoone became unusually fairytale supposed june foundation taylor 1977 itself intended from leaguestandard series wa never development august decision be southwest frustratingly for renounced london relocation fa later club took eventually ron until relocating business year verdict officially mk buckinghamshire which relocated but redevelopment favour independent colour it 2020–21 charles went supermarket gjelsten out røkke binding entered based 1986 lack a 1889 palace first professional milton moving fund team season otherwise mooted meeting administration keen in disaffected crowd would permission announced moved winkelman heritage where move lane 2015 since he 2001 including over 1973 faappointed capital month that 1997 rapidly sam 2007 appointed ranger appointment they larger received there both on 1980s queen south lead 90 injected about launched standard under plough owner businessmen idea limited into not luton 2 make concurrently authorisation starting ahead called inge sought what ha name offered through spent 1979 topflight most renamed had pete ruled delayed allegiance athletic large opened district who go an interim this supporter day location commission operating park 2002 arrangement planning following potential bought refused form reached 97 opposition inter after match prompted 2004 changed subsequently badge briefly afc three final before proposed traditional keep consortium fc so division football commissioner report 1991 end outside envisaged relocate hatter nonleague september at new protest anger mile long stadium meanwhile don and koppel majority crystal established hugely rune to chairman groundshare corporation noades rose arbitration fcs proved	Sports relocation	sport relocation	Sports_teams

Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s–1960s	<p> The <b>Major League Baseball relocations of the 1950s–1960s</b> brought several Major League Baseball franchises to the Western and Southern United States, expanding the league's geographical reach. This was in stark contrast to the early years of modern baseball, when the American League placed teams in National League cities. Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis had two teams; New York City had three. With no teams west of St. Louis or south of Washington, D.C., baseball was effectively confined to the Northeast and Midwest. </p><p>The moves, though controversial in some circles, brought new prosperity to the game of baseball. As of 2022, Chicago remains as the only market with two pre-expansion era teams, the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox, though the White Sox have several times come close to moving. </p><p>Baseball's expansion mirrored the westward movement of the U.S. population during a flourishing postwar economy that saw the arrival of commercial jet travel. Economic push and pull factors caused many teams to move, and the emergence of cities in the new frontier allowed baseball teams to pop up across the country. The moves of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants to California in 1958 opened the West Coast to the market of baseball. </p><p>Since 1960, the National and American Leagues have added 14 teams.</p>	geographical flourishing remains preexpansion contrast american northeast white had early time cub louis franchise reach opened stark arrival movement frontier move added wa this since expanding brooklyn st national several boston many economic major when that relocation prosperity controversial population allowed midwest game economy 1958 two though close up city 2022 1960 effectively year of three circle league chicago southern commercial travel 1950s–1960s pull baseball emergence pop era 14 west south modern saw philadelphia giant some push coast washington dc state market dodger u confined new a no placed mirrored caused or western expansion york have and factor country united the brought come california to moving westward jet team during only sox postwar with across in	1959 senators	1959 senator	Sports_teams

This appellation combined a loose term for the geographical region, ""Thames Valley"", with the Reading team's nickname, ""the Royals"". With each team having financial problems, Maxwell claimed that both were on the verge of going out of business and that uniting them was necessary for the region to retain a Football League club. </p><p>Maxwell envisioned Thames Valley Royals' future home as an unspecified location somewhere between Oxford and Reading where a new stadium would be built, perhaps Didcot; home matches would alternate between Oxford and Reading in the meantime. Both sets of supporters promptly embarked on mass demonstrations against the merger, including protest marches and a 2,000-man sit-in on the pitch at Oxford before a match on 23 April. Maxwell pressed on with his plan regardless, insisting that ""nothing short of the end of the Earth"" would prevent its fruition. </p><p>The proposed amalgamation was stopped by the actions of one of Reading's board directors, Roy Tranter, and Roger Smee, a businessman and former Reading player. Smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in Reading held by the faction of three Reading board members that backed the merger plan, including the chairman Frank Waller, and Tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 April 1983.

Its slogan, ""Red Bull Gives You Wings"", is one of the most popular and memorable advertising slogans in the United States. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a ""brand myth"" through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project. In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships; celebrity endorsements; and music, through its Red Bull Records label.</p><p>Red Bull traces its origins to a similar drink called Krating Daeng, which was introduced in 1976 in Thailand by the pharmacist Chaleo Yoovidhya. Yoovidhya marketed his drink towards labourers and students pitching his product as a means to increase their productivity. He also advertised Krating Daeng in various Thai sporting events such as Muay Thai, which boosted its popularity. While doing business in Thailand, Dietrich Mateschitz purchased a can of Krating Daeng and claimed it cured his jet lag. Mateschitz sought to create a partnership with Yoovidhya and formulated a product that would suit the tastes of Westerners, such as carbonating the product. In 1984 the two founded Red Bull GmbH in 1984 in Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria. When branding their new product Mateschitz referenced Krating Daeng's name as in Thai, <i>daeng</i> means red, and a <i>krating</i> (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild bovine native to the Indian subcontinent. In 1987, the company sold its first can of Red Bull in Europe. In 1996 Red Bull began operation in the United States and has seen steady growth ever since. Both Red Bull and Kraeting Daeng use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market their drinks separately in the Thai and Western markets.

History of the West Indian cricket team	"<p>The <b>history of the West Indian cricket team</b> begins in the 1880s when the first combined West Indian team was formed and toured Canada and the United States. In the 1890s, the first representative sides were selected to play visiting English sides. Administered by the West Indies Cricket Board (""WICB""), and known colloquially as <i><b>The Windies</b></i>, the West Indies cricket team represents a sporting confederation of English-speaking Caribbean countries. </p><p>The WICB joined the sport's international ruling body, the Imperial Cricket Conference, in 1926, and played their first official international match, which in cricket is called a Test, in 1928. Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test nation, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s, by which time the side had changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side. By the late 1970s, the West Indies had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a title they retained throughout the 1980s. Their team from the 1970s and 1980s is now widely regarded as having been one of the best in test cricket's history, alongside Don Bradman's Invincibles. During these glory years, the Windies were noted for their four-man fast bowling attack, backed up by some of the best batsmen in the world. The 1980s saw them set a then-record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984, which was part of a still-standing record of 27 tests without defeat (the other tests being draws), as well as inflicting two 5–0 ""blackwashes"" against the old enemy of England. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, in part due to the rise in popularity of athletics and football in West Indian countries, and the team today is struggling to regain its past glory.</p><p>In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies of the West Indies Federation plus British Guyana. The current side represents the now independent states of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago, and the British dependencies of Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands along with the U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Maarten. National teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites. These national teams take part in the West Indian first-class competition, the Stanford 20/20, the Carib Beer Cup (earlier known as the <i>Busta Cup</i>, <i>Shell Shield</i> and various other names). It is also common for other international teams to play the island teams for warm-up games before they take on the combined West Indies team. </p>"	windies federation these athletics shield 2020 throughout selected sport montserrat attack old had identity played barbuda early time also history joined by barbados favourite confederation player are wicb competition success past other draw imperial well 1890s regarded from plus firstclass lucia part maarten popularity wa without due 1926 indian indie great earlier day british struggling st national begin for visiting formed were colony antigua much cup very unofficial defeat champion invincibles when declined current enemy english best test canada remained play guyana 1880s local island 1930s support caribbean game alongside warmup blackwash along take administered fourman bowling match sporadic them two up until regain changed however they blackdominated glory late board fast 5–0 represented been year of jamaica bradmans before which anguilla nevis is englishspeaking set streak today blessed keep international now separate west whitedominated trinidad on football 1980s independent kitts side ruling it saw representative batsman vincent having consecutive official some noted backed grenada exist england state dependency cricket u 1984 11 1990s carib dominica toured nation a their virgin 1928 record busta colloquially thenrecord being tobago all conference title retained don represents stanford shell and inflicting various one first saint 1970s widely although rise stillstanding known recognised combined country beer united the sporting 1960s grenadine against to body called world team victory during common gloryin 27 with name in 2000s	aspect of history	history aspect of	Sports_teams

History of the Indian cricket team	<p> The Indian cricket team made its Test cricket debut in 1932 and has since advanced to be among the top four test teams in the (ICC rankings) in each of 2005 to 2008. The team won the ODI Cricket World Cup in 1983 and 2011. In other major International victories, Team India won the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 and 2013<i>.</i></p><p>Cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet. </p><p>India won its first World Cup in 1983, under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. The '80s and '90s also saw the debut of Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid, and Kumble, considered to be among the greatest Indian players. </p><p>Ganguly's, captaincy is considered to be the turning point of Indian cricket as it saw great success and became one of the dominant side of the sport, followed by the superb captaincy of MS Dhoni under whom India won its second World Cup in 2011, the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, and Champions Trophy in 2013.

Expansion of Major League Soccer	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Expansion of Major League Soccer</b> has occurred several times since the league began play in 1996. Major League Soccer was established as the top level of professional soccer in the United States in 1993 with 10 teams and began play in 1996. It has expanded several times since 1998 into new markets across the United States and, since 2006, Canada. </p><p>Charlotte FC became the 28th team in the league in 2022. The league plans to reach 30 teams with the addition of Sacramento Republic FC and St. Louis City SC in 2023; however, Sacramento's addition was put on indefinite hold. It may expand to 32 teams at a later date. Expanding and establishing a larger national reach is seen as essential to securing television rights fees needed to reach MLS's stated goal of becoming one of the top leagues in the world by 2022.</p><p>In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record $100 million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015. This record was surpassed by the ownership groups of FC Cincinnati and Nashville SC, which each paid $150 million to join MLS (FC Cincinnati in 2019 and Nashville in 2020). The same amount was paid as an effective entrance fee by a group that bought Columbus Crew SC in 2018, which led to that team's previous operator receiving a new team in Austin, Texas, that joined MLS in April 2021.

List of highest-paid Major League Baseball players	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The highest-paid player in Major League Baseball (MLB) from the 2018 Major League Baseball season is Los Angeles Angels' Center Fielder Mike Trout with an annual salary of $35.54 million on a 12-year contract for $426,500,000. MLB does not have a hard salary cap, instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season. Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $856,850 ($17,356,541 inflation-adjusted from 1934 dollars) over his entire playing career. When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($1,297,689 inflation-adjusted), while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, ""What the hell has Hoover got to do with it? Besides, I had a better year than he did.""</p><p>Alex Rodriguez has signed two record-breaking contracts over the course of his career. First, he signed a $252 million, 10-year contract with the Texas Rangers in December 2000 ($396,528,696 inflation-adjusted from 2000 dollars). Sandy Alderson called the deal ""stupefying"", while <i>Sports Illustrated</i> noted that Rodriguez's early salaries under the contract ($21 million) would be greater than the annual payroll of the entire Minnesota Twins team that year ($15.8 million). The deal was the largest sports contract in history, doubling the total value of Kevin Garnett's $126 million National Basketball Association contract (the previous record holder) and more than doubling Mike Hampton's $121 million contract, the previous MLB record which had been signed just days before. The Rangers later traded Rodriguez to the Yankees in exchange for Alfonso Soriano before the 2004 season, though they agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million outstanding on the contract. Despite this, he opted out of the remainder of his deal after the 2007 season and renegotiated a new $275 million, 10-year agreement with the Yankees, breaking his own record for the largest sports contract. Under this deal, Rodriguez also received $6 million when he tied the career home run total of Willie Mays (660), and would have received $6 million more had he tied Babe Ruth (714), Hank Aaron (755), and Barry Bonds (762), along with another $6 million for breaking Bonds' mark.</p><p>First base was the highest-paid position in 2010; regular starters at that position earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average of $3,014,572. Pitcher Nolan Ryan was the first player to earn an annual salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the Houston Astros in 1979. Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989, in 1990 Jose Canseco signed for 5 years and $23.5 million, making him the first player to earn an average of $4 million a year. It was until 2010 when the MLB average salary rose above that same mark. Five of the twenty highest-paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB.</p>"	december luxury famously i got texas pitcher above 1979 rodriguez 1990 80000 run free agreement nolan whose sport highestpaid pay more had reserve would early time also history asked 252 sandy term starter deal player ruth mike 21 course 179 158 garnetts instead estimated cap member regarded from earned rodriguezs greatest wa an 426500000 illustrated this doe he barry day drawn los same clause be kevin over 275 national tied for were 126 thought major allowing holder when average that twin 5 basketball contract later another twenty mark million while angeles given breaking 660 association 2007 secondlargest aaron henderson certain 4year roughly astros hard previous along 235 after deserved five two 1989 though soriano ranger overall until 2004 undermines president they dollar remainder besides 396528696 trout been year compared of alderson just received 2000 entire league 755 parity before which 762 lower whether markfirst baseball him mlb is 9504165 set total criticism 714 on own career signed negotiation stupefying 6 3554 121 it alfonso end puckett canseco remarked playing 856850 10year 45 ever base his value kirby inflationadjusted earn do noted 2010 out november some angel significantly renegotiated yankee prior 75000 4 exist 12 2018 better paid at dodger claiming didalex babe 12year threshold employing hoover a owner under minnesota traded new their exceeds record may 228835490 signing dictate herbert recordbreaking jose agreed 1 opted not salary have fielder 2013 center did and largest one first hank 1970s bond 17356541 widely exchange willie doubling the 3014572 1934 than to position called team season tax payroll applies despite home houston rickey hampton outstanding 3 wholly what 67 ryan ha 1297689 hell making with rose resulting regular annual in agency greater	Wikimedia list article	list article wikimedia	Sportspeople
NBA salary cap	<p>The <b>NBA salary cap</b> is the limit to the total amount of money that National Basketball Association teams are allowed to pay their players. Like many professional sports leagues, the NBA has a salary cap to control costs and benefit parity, defined by the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA). This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions and is calculated as a percentage of the league's revenue from the previous season. Under the CBA ratified in July 2017, the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues. For the 2019–20 season, the cap is set at $109.14 million.</p><p>The majority of American leagues (NFL, NHL, MLS) have hard caps while the NBA has a soft salary cap. Hard salary caps forbid teams from going above the salary cap. Soft salary caps allow teams to go above the salary cap, but will subject such teams to reduced privileges in free agency. Teams that go above the luxury tax cap are subject to the luxury tax (a tax on every dollar spent over the luxury tax cap). </p>	luxury july control ratified above american agreement free 2017 sport pay subject like by player reduced are future bargaining nhl cap from go benefit this over national for limit complex many millionthe will that 2019–20 basketball allowed while association forbid rule allow previous hard such nba money collective 10914 dollar exception of continue league parity privilege is set total but soft on revenue cost calculated based ml at under their a percentage nfl going every salary have amount and majority professional defined system vary the to team season cba tax ha in agency spent	two way contract	way contract two	Sportspeople
Most valuable player	"<p>In sports, a <b>most valuable player</b> award is an honor typically bestowed upon an individual as the most performing player (or players) in an entire league, for a particular competition, or on a specific team. Initially used in professional sports, the term is now also commonly used in amateur sports, as well as in other unrelated fields such as media, business,, music and multiplayer video games. In many sports, MVP awards are presented for a specific match—in other words, a player of the match award. This is particularly true for high profile matches like championship games. </p><p>The term is most common in the United States and Canada. In most other countries around the world, ""player of the year"" is used for a season-spanning award and ""player of the match"" for individual games. In Australia, Australian rules football clubs and leagues use the term ""best and fairest"", while those playing rugby league use ""player of the year"", such as the Dally M Medal. The National Basketball League, however, uses the American-style ""MVP"" for its awards.</p><p>In many cases the awards are voted on by members of the media.

Association football and politics	<p> <b>Association football and politics</b> are connected in club identities, clashes, and footballers who choose a career in politics. Association football has played a role in maintaining the differences which give each European country a distinct identity, while strengthening the bonds that bind Europe together. According to Macon Benoit, European football underwent a massive transformation during the World War II era (1933–45). The game's sharp rise in popularity came at a time of high political intensity, leading to football's politicization. Benoit writes that during this period, European football began to embody four main characteristics: 1) an agent of international relations, in the sense that the foreign policies of European nations became articulated in matches; 2) a source of political propaganda, as football was used to build national pride and establish the legitimacy of political movements; 3) a tool for social pacification; football gave people a place to focus their energy that was not political, and 4) an avenue for protest; mass gatherings at matches gave spectators a forum for the expression of identity and political sentiments. European football stadiums have assumed other roles as places of refuge and sites of political uprisings and terrorist attacks. As European politics and relations have changed, football has remained a global means of political expression.</p><p>Three former footballers have led their countries: Ahmed Ben Bella, George Weah, and Kaj Leo Johannesen. Ben Bella played briefly for Marseille during the mid-1940s before leading Algeria in the aftermath of its war, first as prime minister and then as president. Weah, who played football for 18 years in Africa and Europe, was an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberian presidency in 2005 before his election in 2017. Johannesen, who played in goal four times for the Faroe Islands national football team during the 1990s, became prime minister of the Faroe Islands in 2008. Other footballers who have sought high political office include Albert Guðmundsson (who finished third in the 1980 Icelandic presidential election) and Oleg Malyshkin, who finished fifth in the 2004 Russian presidential elections. </p>	underwent avenue 2008 2017 give attack identity weah played africa fifth time used office minister are presidency characteristic distinct europe aftermath guðmundsson leo transformation embody propaganda other role who movement social russian forum popularity wa liberian an candidate include this leading according national for former oleg gave unsuccessful spectator that war sense choose refuge remained club maintaining each while prime place third sharp writes island ii foreign malyshkin association game strengthening high mid1940s legitimacy together massive mass match 18 2004 president changed briefly expressionthree articulated ben johannesen year of 1980 led relation site before which faroe bind then era gathering international football four career came benoit sentiment it source political 2005 focus difference his uprising period icelandic global tool assumed energy 4 agent footballer european at ahmed goal 1990s politics main nation a their protest marseille finished terrorist stadium mean build albert pacification politicization policy 1 not began have and bond first 2 pride intensity macon rise algeria country the establish presidential to election world team during clash 3 expression connected sought bella people kaj ha george became in 1933–45	Wikimedia list article	list article wikimedia	Sportspeople

Billy Meredith	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>William Henry Meredith</b> (30 July 1874 – 19 April 1958) was a Welsh professional footballer. He was considered one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for Manchester City and Manchester United. He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales, for whom he scored 11 goals and won two British Home Championship titles. His favoured position was outside right, and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a toothpick during games made him instantly recognisable. </p><p>In 27 seasons in the Football League from 1892 to 1924 (not including the four seasons lost to the First World War and the 1905–06 season in which he was banned for bribing an opposition player), he scored 194 goals in 740 league and cup appearances. He played for Chirk, before joining Northwich Victoria in 1892. His career took off when he signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895. He captained the team to the club's first major honour, a 1–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the 1904 FA Cup Final. He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing Aston Villa half-back Alex Leake £10 to lose a match. There he won the league title in 1907–08 and 1910–11, the FA Cup in 1909, as well as two FA Charity Shields. He also helped to set up the Players' Union, which was a fore-runner of the Professional Footballers' Association. He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at the age of 47 and played a further 32 games before retiring in 1924, making him the oldest ever player for City, United and Wales.

List of cricketers banned for corruption	<p> In cricket, match fixing occurs as a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. In particular, players have been approached by bookmakers and bribed to throw matches or aspects of matches (such as the toss), or provide other essential information. Fixing has happened in both international - including Test matches and One Day Internationals - and domestic cricket. The ban is issued by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's governing body, or by the respective cricket board(s) to which the player belongs. A ban may be for match fixing or spot-fixing.

A banned person is forbidden from employment with MLB or its affiliated minor leagues, and is forbidden from other professional involvement with MLB such as acting as a sports agent for an MLB player.

Sudden cardiac death of athletes	<p>It remains a difficult medical challenge to prevent the <b>sudden cardiac death of athletes</b>, typically defined as natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms, excluding additional time on mechanical life support. (Wider definitions of sudden death are also in use, but not usually applied to the athletic situation.) Most causes relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease with no symptoms noted before the fatal event. The prevalence of any single, associated condition is low, probably less than 0.3% of the population in the athletes' age group, and the sensitivity and specificity of common screening tests leave much to be desired. The single most important predictor is fainting or near-fainting during exercise, which should require detailed explanation and investigation. The victims include many well-known names, especially in professional soccer, and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems. </p>	fainting remains wellknown most time also victim are prevalence athletic probably additional group disease onset situation from hour mechanical include low age be should single for much many natural cause screening test sensitivity population symptom unexpected congenital support typically 03 specificity often cardiovascular medical close sudden fatal applied prevent of le relate soccer before which explanation is detailed but on it risk life similar event noted athlete difficult usually arrest death require at a no definition use problem excluding acquired desired within or cardiac not exercise and one professional investigation defined wider the condition important than to common during especially relative challenge any predictor collapse with leave name associated nearfainting in	natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest of athletes	death unexpected cardiac natural from of athlete arrest	Sportspeople

Three years later, he was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for £2.2 million. He won the FA Cup with Spurs in 1991, before being sold to Italian club Lazio for £5.5 million.

He has been jailed or sectioned on numerous occasions and his struggles receive regular coverage in the British press.

The modes of travel, time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe. Most people in least-developed countries continue to walk to work, as the ancestors of all people did until the nineteenth century. The cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle, so this is common in low-income countries, but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental and health reasons. In middle-income countries, motorcycle commuting is very common. The next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location: in more populous, older cities, especially in Eurasia mass transit (rail, bus, etc.) predominates, while in smaller, younger cities, and large parts of North America and Australasia, communing by personal automobile is more common. A small number of very wealthy people, and those working in remote locations around the world, also commute by air travel, often for a week or more at a time rather the more typical daily commute. Transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions, allowing a distinction to arise between mostly-residential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city (process known as suburban sprawl), but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies, with Eurasian ""suburbs"" often being more densely populated than North American ""urban cores"". </p>"	sometimes younger nineteenth american commuting most number workrelated more century between predominates time also by leaf society leastdeveloped drastically large link lowincome distinction where arise part walking can urban populated referred this method mode next layout dependent densely be periodically economically taken location for rail smaller very those etc remain allowing when health that older while place mostlyresidential sprawl distance impact small suburban mass often ancestor after until city even of environmental continue week transportation travel traveler is repeated communing but residence adopted focused rather so technology commuter on personal develop america it region bus around increasingly suburb air different extension enable usually community at a their recurring transit remote practised being all bicycle boundary or not walk and did one motorcycle work traveled cheapest widely wealthy process known eurasia country the middleincome realized daily than to world common especially home core typical wealthier any commute varies how populous people automobile eurasian study australasia across reason with regular working north physical specific globe in	periodically recurring travel between one's place of residence and place of work, or study	and between travel one work or study place recurring of residence periodically	Transport

Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during periods of high pollution or high fuel prices. Car sharing is a good way to use up the full seating capacity of a car, which would otherwise remain unused if it were just the driver using the car. </p><p>In 2009, carpooling represented 43.5% of all trips in the United States and 10% of commute trips. The majority of carpool commutes (over 60%) are ""fam-pools"" with family members.</p><p>Carpool commuting is more popular for people who work in places with more jobs nearby, and who live in places with higher residential densities. Carpooling is significantly correlated with transport operating costs, including fuel prices and commute length, and with measures of social capital, such as time spent with others, time spent eating and drinking and being unmarried.

Intermodal passenger transport	<p><b>Intermodal passenger transport</b>, also called <b>mixed-mode commuting</b>, involves using two or more modes of transportation in a journey. Mixed-mode commuting is often used to combine the strengths (and offset the weaknesses) of various transportation options. A major goal of modern intermodal passenger transport is to reduce dependence on the automobile as the major mode of ground transportation and increase use of public transport. To assist the traveller various intermodal journey planners such as Rome2rio and Google Transit have been devised to help travellers to plan and schedule their journey. </p><p>Mixed-mode commuting often centers on one type of rapid transit, such as regional rail, to which low-speed options (i.e. bus, tram, or bicycle) are appended at the beginning or end of the journey. Trains offer quick transit from a suburb into an urban area, where passengers can choose a way to complete the trip.

Super commuter	"<p>A <b>super commuter</b> is a person who works in the central county or downtown core of a metropolitan area and resides outside that metropolitan area.</p><p>In some metropolitan areas, costs of living are inhibitive to middle- and lower-income workers. As a result, some choose to live in more affordable metropolitan areas that are separate from the metropolitan area in which they work. Super commuters travel long distances, either daily, or once or twice a week between home and workplace either by air, rail, bus, and sometimes also by car, or a combination of modes.<sup class=""reference nowrap"">: <span title=""Page: 1 Quotation : &quot;And that has given Stockton one of the nation's highest concentrations of &quot;extreme commuters&quot; who travel 90 or more minutes to work. Long commutes are, of course, not unique to Northern California. The number of commuters who travel 90 or more minutes to work is almost 3 percent nationwide. But the phenomenon is even more evident in the Bay Area, where the numbers rose to nearly 5 percent from 3 percent in just three years, according to an analysis of census data by the Brookings Institution. In Stockton, 8 percent of commuters travel 90 minutes or more.&quot;"">1</span> </sup> Often, super commuters spend most of the work week in the city their office is based, returning home on weekends. </p><p>Super commuters are generally younger in age than average workers, and tend to be from a middle class background. They are not elite business travellers; they try to cut their costs by taking benefit of higher wages in one region and lower housing and transportation costs in the more affordable metropolitan area in which they reside. </p><p>A 2012 study by New York University's Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management showed that Manhattan alone has existing population of 59,000 super commuters. According to studies conducted in NYU there is great upsurge in this trend and 8 out of 10 of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S show similar findings. </p><p>Some super commuters reside and work in separate metropolitan areas due to their relationships in which both partners are employed. One partner may be well-employed in one metropolitan area, while another has valuable employment in the other metropolitan area. Megan Bearce, a marriage and family therapist and author of the book named <i>Super Commuter Couples: Staying Together When A Job Keeps You Apart</i> refers that there were an estimated 3.42 million full time workers who were super commuters in 2012 in the U.S. The phenomenon has been getting increasing coverage on media.

Reverse commute	<p>A <b>reverse commute</b> is a round trip, regularly taken, from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning, and returning in the evening. It is almost universally applied to trips to work in the suburbs from homes in the city. This is in opposition to the regular commute, where a person lives in the suburbs and travels to work in the city. </p><p>The reverse commuter travels in the opposite direction of the regular daily traffic flow during rush hour, and therefore encounters less road traffic congestion faced by regular commuters. An advantage of this system is the usage of otherwise empty transit capacity: no additional trains or travel lanes are necessary to accommodate people riding or driving from downtown to the outskirts in the morning, and likewise back downtown at night. Train and bus routes may be more sparse in the reverse direction, but the vehicles have to get back somehow for their next journey in most cases. However, track capacity on some railroads (for example, the Long Island Rail Road in the suburbs of New York City) significantly reduces or even eliminates reverse commute options. Hence, transit usage can be lower for reverse-commuters than regular commuters. In some cases, reverse commuting has become quite popular. For example, Metro-North Railroad runs rush hour New Haven Line trains from New York City to Stamford, CT and surrounding suburbs to accommodate its many reverse commuters. Low unemployment rates in the suburbs may help to fuel the increase over the past years in reverse commuter ridership.</p><p>However, the very reasons commuting makes sense (such as higher employment in the city and lower housing prices in the suburbs) operate against the reverse commuter, so people doing so are less common compared to those going the other way. However, these traditional schools of thought are changing, especially in Southern and Western US cities, where employment options tend to follow a more decentralized or polycentric model than Midwest or Eastern US cities. For instance, on the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles, there are more vehicles in the morning peak hour heading westbound towards Santa Monica than into Downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>An example of reverse commuting can be found in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Due to a combination of ample transit infrastructure and the height limit in downtown, employment options in the area follow a polycentric model, heavily focused in both Downtown and areas such as Arlington, Tysons, Bethesda, and Silver Spring. Companies desiring space in Washington often opt for space in Maryland or Virginia because of the great expense of office space downtown. As such, there are many people who live in Washington and work in Maryland and Virginia, either driving, taking Metrobus, Metrorail, or carpooling.</p><p>A significant amount of reverse commuting occurs in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many workers live in San Francisco and work in job centers in Silicon Valley such as Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Cupertino. As of 2013, ridership on Caltrain during peak hours consisted of about 60% traditional commuters and 40% reverse commuters.</p>	case option maryland higher these reduces run most commuting instance reversecommuters 40 more stamford train by office tyson housing palo rush haven become road are therefore night metropolitan additional past other caltrain who from returning where riding urban lane can hour an popular evening doing spring low due live this great next los be francisco area over taken for rail limit faced many very those thought usage eliminates company congestion expense morning desiring sense school view metronorth increase because angeles either island opposite midwest almost unemployment opt job opposition suburban heavily often route such cupertino silver san however city encounter regularly ample bethesda even help operate ridershiphowever angelesan applied compared year metrorail of infrastructure le ct freeway 60 southern travel traffic lower there occurs both is traditional round but focused somehow so valley height commuter on trip empty quite it way bus combination advantage line reverse likewise life follow track eastern space about vehicle sparse outskirt some employment suburb significantly washington downtown significant accommodate at u new a no transit their taking long peak may universally found santa surrounding into or hence western driving silicon going metrobus york example consisted have person 2013 and amount center one work make fuel towards tend bay capacity alto system rate the daily against polycentric than to arlington carpoolinga worker flow mountain common during journey especially home direction monica necessary railroad virginia commute otherwise people ha westbound back reason get heading regular price model ridership in changing decentralized	round trip from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning, and returning in the evening	the an and evening one trip to suburban a from returning round area in morning urban	Transport
Cross border commuters in the Berlin area 1948–1961	<p>The problem with <b>cross-border commuters</b> (German, <i>Grenzgänger</i>) in the Berlin area was a result of the political separation of East- and West Berlin in the years of 1948 and 1949. It resulted from the affiliations of the municipalities to two different currencies; East Berlin districts would use the East German mark (Mark der DDR), and West Berlin districts would use the German mark (DM). Another cause was the difference is residential and industrial areas throughout Berlin, with the western districts being more prosperous. The Socialist Unity Party (SED), which governed East Berlin, used the matter of cross-border commuters in its propaganda, citing them as a problem, which helped them to justify the construction of the Berlin Wall, starting in August 1961. </p>	in residential being which grenzgänger throughout western is sed construction cause more citing dm west currency commuter and would party ddr used another mark matter 1948 it political resulted german 1949 the difference affiliation starting crossborder to district propaganda governed east different from 1961 two them wall der socialist wa justify august separation municipality with industrial a year berlin of use prosperous area result unity helped problem	Politics	politics	Transport

Metrocargo Intermodal Transport	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>MIT (Metrocargo Intermodal Transport) is a project partly funded by the European Union under the Programme “Research for the benefit of SMEs“ – Call ID “FP7-SME-2011” and managed by Research Executive Agency. Metrocargo is a concept of intermodal shipment based on horizontal loading and unloading containers and swap bodies on standard flatbed wagons under the overhead electric feeding line. The system being fully automated and very efficient, it is time and cost effective for the distributed intermodal transport over a territory and for processing full trains in port to dry port shuttling. The promoters constructed a full-scale prototype unit and the EC-funded research pro-ject VIT Vision for Innovative Transport successfully researched the remaining technical issues. This MIT <b>Metrocargo Intermodal Transport</b> project is about bringing Metrocargo from research to market stage and promoting its dissemination among logistic decision-makers throughout Europe. Technically, MIT will implement specific technical improvements and the scaling up from single prototypal unit to full industrial installation, developing typical plant design and SW applications to automate and optimise the work flow and provide interfaces with operators and external systems. Promotion and dissemination will be the main goal, carrying out market studies in several EU member states and subsequent market plans to exploit the Metrocargo features in terms of installation and operating costs, limited use of dock area, safety and environmental impact. Economic advantages to operators in typical situations will be deter-mined effecting specific feasibility studies. Dissemination events will be organised centred on the full scale Metrocargo prototype installed in the port of Vado Ligure. The SMEs will exhibit the system in main logistic and transport shows in Europe and will organise road-show presentations in several countries, using videos and a dynamic simulation SW tool to illustrate the solutions for specific needs. At the end of this Project the Metrocargo technology will be a fully developed market-ready system that will be widely known among European logistic decision makers. </p>"	optimise sw plan promotion throughout call train time prototype by dissemination term full europe concept overhead intermodal unit subsequent member situation territory from roadshow benefit “ this union dock bringing partly executive effective industrial be decision over installation distributed area processing several for single simulation maker application operating very project efficient will economic installed feeding loading that metrocargo carrying centred vision vado plant among provide ecfunded impact effecting innovative technical stage automated need managed organised up ligure vit promoting of constructed environmental video interface decisionmakers logistic is illustrate ” technology on external automate cost design fully feasibility exploit it eu end smes advantage flatbed line – about prototypal feature electric solution mit dry operator event shipment shuttling out tool based unloading standard safety presentation state market european at implement determined goal main under a use funded being using issue swap limited fp7sme2011 container scaling organise promoter and work improvement research widely researched developing id known horizontal system country the to body remaining flow typical port show scale programme developed technically fullscale marketready successfully study with dynamic specific exhibit in agency wagon transport	European Project partly founded by the EC	the european founded by project partly ec	Transport

Rolling highway	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p>In rail transportation, a <b>rolling highway</b>, or <b>rolling road</b> is a form of combined transport involving the conveying of road trucks by rail, referred to as Ro-La trains. The concept is a form of piggyback transportation. </p><p>The technical challenges to implement rolling highways vary from region to region. In North America, the loading gauge is often high enough to accommodate double stack containers, so the height of a semi-trailer on a flatcar is no issue. However, in Europe, except for purpose built lines such as the Channel Tunnel or the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the loading gauge height is much smaller, and it is necessary to transport the trailers with the tires about 30 cm (11.81 in) above the rails, so the trailers cannot be simply parked on the surface of a flat car above the wagon wheels or bogies. Making the wagon wheels smaller limits the maximum speed, so many designs allow the trailer to be transported with its wheels lower than the rail wagon wheels. An early approach in France was the <i>Kangourou wagon</i> with modified trailers. This technology did not survive, due to the market resistance to modified trailers. Today, three designs for these special wagons are in commercial service, ""Modalohr"", ""CargoBeamer"" and ""Niederflurwagen"" . </p><p>During a rolling-highway journey, if the drivers accompany the trailer, they are accommodated in a passenger car or a sleeping car.

Commuting	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Commuting</b> is periodically recurring travel between one's place of residence and place of work or study, where the traveler, referred to as a <b>commuter</b>, leaves the boundary of their home community. By extension, it can sometimes be any regular or often repeated travel between locations, even when not work-related. The modes of travel, time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe. Most people in least-developed countries continue to walk to work, as the ancestors of all people did until the nineteenth century. The cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle, so this is common in low-income countries, but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental and health reasons. In middle-income countries, motorcycle commuting is very common. The next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location: in more populous, older cities, especially in Eurasia mass transit (rail, bus, etc.) predominates, while in smaller, younger cities, and large parts of North America and Australasia, communing by personal automobile is more common. A small number of very wealthy people, and those working in remote locations around the world, also commute by air travel, often for a week or more at a time rather the more typical daily commute. Transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions, allowing a distinction to arise between mostly-residential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city (process known as suburban sprawl), but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies, with Eurasian ""suburbs"" often being more densely populated than North American ""urban cores"". </p>"	sometimes younger nineteenth american commuting most number workrelated more century between predominates time also by leaf society leastdeveloped drastically large link lowincome distinction where arise part walking can urban populated referred this method mode next layout dependent densely be periodically economically taken location for rail smaller very those etc remain allowing when health that older while place mostlyresidential sprawl distance impact small suburban mass often ancestor after until city even of environmental continue week transportation travel traveler is repeated communing but residence adopted focused rather so technology commuter on personal develop america it region bus around increasingly suburb air different extension enable usually community at a their recurring transit remote practised being all bicycle boundary or not walk and did one motorcycle work traveled cheapest widely wealthy process known eurasia country the middleincome realized daily than to world common especially home core typical wealthier any commute varies how populous people automobile eurasian study australasia across reason with regular working north physical specific globe in	periodically recurring travel between one's place of residence and place of work, or study	and between travel one work or study place recurring of residence periodically	Transport
Road ecology	<p><b>Road ecology</b> is the study of the ecological effects (both positive and negative) of roads and highways (public roads). These effects may include local effects, such as on noise, water pollution, habitat destruction/disturbance and local air quality; and the wider environmental effects of transport such as habitat fragmentation, ecosystem degradation, and climate change from vehicle emissions. </p><p>The design, construction and management of roads, parking and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of vehicles can change their effect. Roads are known to cause significant damage to forests, prairies, streams and wetlands. Besides the direct habitat loss due to the road itself, and the roadkill of animal species, roads alter water-flow patterns, increase noise, water, and air pollution, create disturbance that alters the species composition of nearby vegetation thereby reducing habitat for local native animals, and act as barriers to animal movements. Roads are a form of linear infrastructure intrusion that has some effects similar to infrastructure such as railroads, power lines, and canals, particularly in tropical forests.</p><p>Road ecology is practiced as a field of inquiry by a variety of ecologists, biologists, hydrologists, engineers, and other scientists. There are several global centers for the study of road ecology: 1) The Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis, which was the first of its kind in the world; 2) the Centro Brasileiro de Estudos em Ecologia de Estradas at the Federal University of Lavras, Brazil; 3) The Center for Transportation and the Environment, North Carolina State University; and 4) the Road Ecology Program at the Western Transportation Institute, Montana State University. There are also several important global conferences for road ecology research: 1) Infra-Eco Network Europe (IENE), which is international, but focused primarily on Europe; 2) International Conference on Ecology and Transportation (ICOET), which is also global in scope, but primarily focused on the US; 3) Australasian Network for Ecology &amp; Transportation (ANET), which focuses on the Australasian (sub)continent; and 4) a potential Southern African road ecology conference, being considered by the Endangered Wildlife Trust.</p>	ecologist these wetland hydrologist construction also by native federal road itself are europe university facility other well movement from subcontinent em can wa scope wildlife include due linear icoet loss pollution engineer disturbance quality davis several for montana change reducing emission cause water waterflow that lavras potential direct roadkill related increase form local effect carolina brasileiro destructiondisturbance fragmentation habitat regulation such negative alters tropical barrier kind anet endangered ecology create besides of infrastructure environment environmental composition parking transportation which southern primarily vegetation there both is trust practiced network but focused international brazil on damage australasian scientist it ecologia forestsroad nearby intrusion focus line similar vehicle some ecological global air 4 centro state significant at u particularly act biologist a their animal stream power forest may considered being conference noise public western management estradas 1 variety canal infraeco positive and degradation center first inquiry 2 research known climate wider thereby the important de prairie to pattern california world highway african amp estudos railroad 3 iene program specie ha study ecosystem alter north institute in field design transport	ecology of roadside habitats	ecology roadside habitat of	Transport
Exhaust gas	<p><b>Exhaust gas</b> or flue gas is emitted as a result of the combustion of fuels such as natural gas, gasoline (petrol), diesel fuel, fuel oil, biodiesel blends, or coal.

Interlining	"<p><b>Interlining</b>, also known as <b>interline ticketing</b> and <b>interline booking</b>, is a voluntary commercial agreement between individual airlines to handle passengers traveling on itineraries that require multiple flights on multiple airlines. Such agreements allow passengers to change from one flight on one airline to another flight on another airline without having to gather their bags or check-in again. Airlines can also promise free rebooking if the connection is lost due to a delay. </p><p>Interlining agreements differ from codeshare agreements in that codeshare agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline's code (abbreviation) even though the flight is operated by another airline. However, codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket (or e-ticket) can be issued, since both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare operating carrier must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued. </p><p>Interline agreements are directional. For example, it may be possible for American Airlines to issue the ticket on an American-United itinerary, but United might not be able to be issuer on the same itinerary. Such a one-directional interline agreement is called a unilateral interline. The airlines may also agree to enter a bilateral interline agreement, where each airline can issue the ticket on the other airline. </p><p>Previously, only large network carriers such as United Airlines and Lufthansa would have electronic ticket interline agreements, but the IATA mandate to eliminate paper tickets at the end of 2007 has changed this by forcing smaller carriers to implement electronic ticketing. </p><p>Smaller legacy carriers commonly have interline agreements with large network carriers that fly into their markets. Most newer low-cost airlines that only sell directly to consumers (and not through agencies or Global distribution systems) do not support interlining at all. </p><p>If no interline ticketing agreement exists, then two separate tickets will need to be issued, and passengers will have to retrieve their bags and carry it to the connecting airline for check-in. Itineraries with interline connections such as this are riskier for travelers, since the second carrier may be unaware of delays or issues with the incoming flight and is less likely to permit a rebooking without cost if the connection is lost. There can also be a problem if luggage is lost and the traveler wants it to be sent to them later. </p><p>Most online travel agencies will only display itineraries that can be ticketed on one of their booking systems. However, some ticket websites will sometimes display un-ticketable interline itineraries. Examples could be found previously on routes to Mexico involving the now defunct Aero California, or may be currently found on routes to Indonesia involving Lion Air. These are often displayed as ""contact airline to buy"". </p> "	fly these operated sometimes checkin american agreement free most agree permit multiple distribution would between issuer commonly able also iata by interlining americanunited enter are ticketing newer consumer connection large codeshare directional must other ticketed from where forcing can without involving likely an possible due connecting since this promise abbreviation same currently be airline single for smaller operating code booking will differ change legacy rebooking that delay could later another each itinerary issued carrier 2007 support online individual allow often need route such two them though however changed website mexico interline even bilateral voluntary unticketable of might le lost commercial travel whether there traveler both then is handle ticket but network separate now defunct incoming on carry onedirectional lufthansa sell cost electronic eticket it end mandate display exists having do some global air usually marketing market at implement lowcost a their no bag eliminate indonesia may problem riskier flight all issue found paper into or buy retrieve contact not example have numbering displayed and one if directly unilateral previously known second system sent united the affect california to lion called traveling only again unaware luggage aero relationship ha with want through require in agency passenger gather refers	airline practice	airline practice	Transport

Also, some transport companies will allow employees to use the service when off duty, such as a city bus line allowing an off-duty driver to commute to and from work, free. </p><p>Additionally, inspectors from a regulatory agency may use transport on a deadhead basis to do inspections such as a Federal Railroad Administration inspector riding a freight train to inspect for safety violations. </p>"	lieu inspection free would train also accepting term federal inspect revenuegaining driver from move freight riding without an include day los basis ec begin employee for airline will allowing nonrevenue company when service uniform off inspector carrying dead car angeles either carrier additionally charter running light simply coming allow such living city uk of might wearing operates offduty is ticket on leg empty trip catch it bus line pilot similar vehicle showing do some air stock safety garage new a their assign administration use may flight buying or public going york example violation and practice first work tow id dit the to common regulatory applies deadheading coaching duty railroad any commute mileage deadhead denver in agency passenger transport	public transport vehicle non-commercial movement	vehicle public movement noncommercial transport	Transport
Traffic congestion	<p><b>Traffic congestion</b> is a condition in transport that is characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially since the 1950s. When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream, this results in some congestion. While congestion is a possibility for any mode of transportation, this article will focus on automobile congestion on public roads. </p><p>As demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the road), extreme traffic congestion sets in.

Flight cancellation and delay	<p>A <b>flight delay</b> is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. A <b>cancellation</b> occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason. </p><p>In the European Union, Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 states that flight delays for over three hours, cancellations and denied boarding entitles passengers to a compensation from €250 up to €600 per passenger from the airline.</p><p>In the United States, when flights are canceled or delayed, passengers may be entitled to compensation due to rules obeyed by every flight company, usually Rule 240, or Rule 218 in certain locations. This rule usually specifies that passengers may be entitled to certain reimbursements, including a free room if the next flight is the day after the canceled one, a choice of reimbursement, rerouting, phone calls, and refreshments. When a flight is delayed, the FAA allocates slots for takeoffs and landings based on which flight is scheduled first. The Transportation Department imposes a fine of up to $27,500 per passenger for planes left on the tarmac for more than three hours without taking off (four hours for international flights). However, passengers are not entitled to direct monetary compensation under US law when a delay occurs. Instead, airlines are merely required to pay for lodging costs of passengers if the delay or a cancellation is through their own fault, but not if the cause is beyond their control, such as weather.</p>	control minute 27500 free department call pay more time by delayed federal are instead from required without hour an lodging due choice this andor union doe next day be including over airline for location land per landing company when cause off that €600 direct delay scheduled later merely certain rule take after 15 regulation such faa up €250 allocates however operate aviation of three passenger transportation slot which occurs is but international on own four left 218 cancellation cost it rerouting plane takeoff compensation 240 room obeyed based law usually state european at u under a their taking fault refreshment denied may entitles beyond phone flight all or every reimbursement not considers and one first if specifies weather united the canceled than to boarding 2612004 tarmac imposes monetary reason fine through administration airlinein in entitled	not operating a scheduled flight	scheduled flight operating a not	Transport

Homesickness	<p><b>Homesickness</b> is the distress caused by being away from home. Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects. Sufferers typically report a combination of depressive and anxious symptoms, withdrawn behavior and difficulty focusing on topics unrelated to home. Experienced by children and adults, the affected person may be taking a short trip to a nearby place, such as summer camp, or they may be taking a long trip or have moved to a different country.</p><p>In its mild form, homesickness prompts the development of coping skills and motivates healthy attachment behaviors, such as renewing contact with loved ones. Nearly all people miss something about home when they are away, making homesickness a nearly universal experience. However, intense homesickness can be painful and debilitating.</p>	attachment withdrawn short coping by object prompt moved are hallmark distress from countryin experienced can development universal homesickness be renewing thought when skill symptom form place mild nearly typically intense such debilitating difficulty however they experience of topic is motivates on report affected trip it combination loved depressive nearby anxious about different camp sufferer a taking long may being summer all something caused healthy or contact preoccupying have person and away one behavior focusing painful unrelated the to child home adult people making with miss cognitive	distress caused by being away from home	away being by caused distress from home	Transport
Travel photography	<p><b>Travel photography</b> is a genre of photography that may involve the documentation of an area's landscape, people, cultures, customs, and history. The Photographic Society of America defines a travel photo as an image that expresses the feeling of a time and place, portrays a land, its people, or a culture in its natural state, and has no geographical limitations.</p><p>Travel photography as a genre is one of the most open in terms of the subjects it covers. Many travel photographers specialize in a particular aspect of photography such as travel portraits, landscape or documentary photography as well as shooting all aspects of travel. Much of today's Travel Photography style is derived from early work in Magazines such as National Geographic magazine from photographers such as Steve McCurry. This genre of photography entails shooting a wide variety of subjects under varied available conditions, e.g. low light photography indoors, available ambient light photography for exteriors of buildings and monuments, shooting on the streets where sometimes conditions may be hostile, capturing moments which rarely recur, capturing the magic of light while shooting landscapes, etc. </p><p>As travel has become more accessible, more and more, the genre is opening up to amateurs and professionals alike. Amateur Travel photography is often shared through sites like Flickr, 500px and 1x. Travel photography, unlike other genres like fashion, product, or food photography, is still an underestimated and relatively less monetized genre, though the challenges faced by travel photographers are a lot greater than some of the genres where the light and other shooting conditions may be controllable. Traditionally travel photographers earned money through Stock photography, magazine assignments, and commercial projects. Nowadays, the stock photography market has collapsed and more and more photographers are using more innovative methods of earning a living such as through blogging, public speaking, commercial projects, and teaching. </p>	exterior geographical sometimes earning limitationstravel portrait most unlike accessible rarely more subject early nowadays time like history by hostile term photo society become street are monument defines 1x express well moment other from where earned shooting open shared traditionally aspect an low recur this steve landscape method eg be area derived national for land feeling much faced many building project etc documentary natural that custom fashion opening while place light ambient innovative lot product still culture style often flickr food such amateur money living up though magic entail teaching of magazine alike le site travel photography which commercial portrays is genre today assignment monetized cover on particular america it relatively blogging controllable some stock mccurry capturing state market involve under a no may using all or public variety photographic wide image and underestimated one work varied professional documentation geographic 500px the condition specialize than to photographer available challenge people collapsed ha speaking through in greater indoors	photography genre	genre photography	Transport
Travelers' diarrhea	"<p><b>Travelers' diarrhea</b> (<b>TD</b>) is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed stool (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling. It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, headache and bloating. Occasionally bloody diarrhea may occur. Most travelers recover within three to four days with little or no treatment. About 10% of people may have symptoms for a week.</p><p>Bacteria are responsible for more than half of cases. The bacteria enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) are typically the most common except in Southeast Asia, where <i>Campylobacter</i> is more prominent. About 10 to 20 percent of cases are due to norovirus. Protozoa such as <i>Giardia</i> may cause longer term disease. The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults. People affected are more often from the developed world.</p><p>Recommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food, drinking bottled water, and frequent hand washing. The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for cholera, is of questionable use for travelers' diarrhea. Preventive antibiotics are generally discouraged. Primary treatment includes rehydration and replacing lost salts (oral rehydration therapy). Antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms, and can be taken with loperamide to decrease diarrhea. Hospitalization is required in less than 3 percent of cases.</p><p>Estimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50 percent among travelers to the developing world. TD is particularly common among people traveling to Asia (except for Japan and Singapore), the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. The risk is moderate in Southern Europe, Russia, and China. TD has been linked to later irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain–Barré syndrome. It has colloquially been known by a number of names, including ""Montezuma's revenge,"" the ""Nile runs"" and ""Delhi belly"".</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1374 Cached time: 20220514124024 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.444 seconds Real time usage: 0.522 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1079/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 29654/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1828/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 9/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 20917/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.252/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5678685/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 467.726 1 -total 29.80% 139.378 2 Template:Cite_book 20.55% 96.097 2 Template:Short_description 19.67% 91.981 1 Template:Infobox_medical_condition_(new) 15.04% 70.359 1 Template:Infobox 8.73% 40.849 2 Template:Pagetype 8.41% 39.327 1 Template:Redirect2 6.88% 32.166 4 Template:Cite_journal 6.87% 32.115 6 Template:Main_other 5.61% 26.241 3 Template:Cite_web -->"	case eating delhi therapy occasionally weekbacteria run antibiotic most preventive prevention number more africa by unformed term are revenge europe decrease bacteria disease questionable where young enterotoxigenic from properly central required greatest can includes include range due bowel headache infection intestinal day diarrhea effective be including taken for accompanied others cooked hand cause water nile russia prominent symptom later bloody while among singapore typically except salt frequent passage guillain–barré abdominal td often food east montezuma such two half casesestimates coli mexico percent recommended been generally of three le escherichia week stomach lost southern travel traveler middle is replacing southeast campylobacter four affected oral america south it moderate etec fever hospitalization cleaned nausea risk bloating about some china washing asia cholera linked rehydration significant belly particularly recover stool a no definition occur use primary japan may irritable bottled protozoa percentage colloquially 20 vaccine within or syndrome 50 10 giardia have and one first drinking developing defined known the loperamide discouraged than to world treatment common norovirus traveling worldrecommendations 3 longer only adult cramp developed persistent responsible people ha little with name in	disease	disease	Transport

For example, both the plan of a business trip and the route of a road trip, or the proposed outline of one, are travel itineraries. </p><p>The construction of a travel itinerary may be assisted by the use of travel literature, including travel journals and diaries, a guide book containing information for visitors or tourists about the destination, or a trip planner website dedicated to helping the users plan their trips. Typically a travel itinerary is prepared by a travel agent who assists one in conducting their travel for business or leisure. Most commonly a travel agent provides a list of pre-planned travel itineraries to a traveller, who can then pick one that they're most satisfied with. However, with the advent of the internet, online maps, navigation, online trip planners and easier access to travel information in general, travellers, especially the younger ones prefer a more do-it-yourself approach to travel planning.</p><p>Since a travel itinerary might serve different purposes for different kinds of travellers, it is crucial for a travel agent to know all the characteristics of her/his target of customers.

Accessibility of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The physical accessibility of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s public transit network, serving the New York metropolitan area, is incomplete. Although all buses are wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), much of the MTA's rail system was built before wheelchair access was a requirement under the ADA. This includes the MTA's rapid transit systems, the New York City Subway and Staten Island Railway, and its commuter rail services, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and Metro-North Railroad. Consequently, most stations were not designed to be accessible to people with disabilities, and many MTA facilities lack accessible announcements, signs, tactile components, and other features. </p><p>A city law, the New York City Human Rights Law, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. Since 1990, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA, with most grade-level stations requiring little modification to meet ADA standards. Additionally, the MTA identified 100 ""key stations"", high-traffic and/or geographically important stations on the subway system, which have been or are being renovated to comply with the ADA. One of the key tenets of the Fast Forward Plan to rescue the subway system released in 2018 is to drastically increase the number of ADA-accessible subway stations, adding accessible facilities to 70 stations by 2024. </p>"	tenet incomplete component 1990 comply plan human american most number released accessible 70 renovated by discrimination road are drastically metropolitan facility other staten subway consequently disability right wa includes this since mta andor basis designed be area built elevator rail were much many service forward metronorth increase island compliance additionally modification rescue city wheelchairaccessible fast been geographically of newly adding constructed 100 transportation before announcement prohibits which access identified is requiring network commuter on it bus feature station law standard rapid adaaccessible 2018 mtas ada lack act new under a transit long being all tactile or public requirement not york lirr have and one meet hightraffic although gradelevel serving sign 2024 system the authority railway important to wheelchair railroad accessibility people little with key physical in	accessibility of public transportation system in New York	transportation accessibility public new york of in system	Transport

Next Generation Supersonic Transport	<p>The <b>Next Generation Supersonic Transport</b> is a supersonic transport (SST) being developed by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA. By comparison to the Concorde, the new design will carry three times the passengers (300), fly at roughly the same speed (Mach 2) 1,522.4 mph (2,450.1 km/h), and have twice the range. The goal is to achieve a ticket price comparable to that of subsonic business class. JAXA had expected to launch the plane by 2015. An 11.5-meter prototype was tested on October 10, 2005.</p><p>One of the most crucial factors in the commercial viability of a supersonic transport is the strength of the sonic boom it generates. The boom created by Concorde was powerful enough to prevent the aircraft from flying supersonically over land, thus eliminating many possible passenger routes (and contributing to the cancellation of Concorde's American rival, the Boeing 2707). Since the 1960s however, a number of techniques have been developed that may reduce the effect (see the sonic boom article). On May 9, 2008, JAXA announced it would collaborate with NASA to conduct joint research on sonic boom modeling.</p><p>JAXA is also researching hypersonic transport (Mach 5.0+) 3,806 mph (6,125 km/h), though the goal is not use for commercial aircraft cost competitive with current aircraft.</p>	fly modelingjaxa 2008 american most number flying aircraft expected had would time prototype also by 2707 supersonic launch announced 300 joint technique mph from 6125 generation enough wa an possible range conduct 2015 since subsonic next same over for land many will current sonic that eliminating tested generates boeing effect rival researching competitive roughly route though however comparison business mach been 3806 of prevent three thus supersonically commercial 115meter article viability is achieve ticket collaborate strength on boom carry contributing cancellation 15224 cost it 24501 jaxa plane 2005one space sst nasa speed class concorde at crucial goal new a concordes created use may being reduce 50 10 not have and factor twice 2 research 9 comparable japanese the 1960s october to hypersonic kmh powerful developed with price see in agency design passenger transport	supersonic airliner development project	project airliner supersonic development	Transport

The L-2000 lost the contract to the Boeing 2707, but that competing design was ultimately canceled for political, environmental and economic reasons. </p><p>In 1961, President John F. Kennedy committed the government to subsidizing 75% of the development of a commercial airliner to compete with the Anglo-French Concorde then under development. The director of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Najeeb Halaby, elected to improve upon the Concorde's design rather than compete head-to-head with it. The SST, which might have represented a significant advance over the Concorde, was intended to carry 250 passengers (a large number at the time, more than twice as many as Concorde), fly at Mach 2.7-3.0, and have a range of 4,000 mi (7,400 km). </p><p>The program was launched on June 5, 1963, and the FAA estimated that by 1990 there would be a market for 500 SSTs.

Boeing 2707	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Boeing 2707</b> was an American supersonic passenger airliner project during the 1960s. After winning a competition for a government-funded contract to build an American supersonic airliner, Boeing began development at its facilities in Seattle, Washington. The design emerged as a large aircraft with seating for 250 to 300 passengers and cruise speeds of approximately Mach 3. It was intended to be much larger and faster than preceding SST designs such as Concorde. </p><p>The SST was the topic of considerable concern within and outside the aviation industry. From the start, the airline industry noted that the economics of the design were questionable, concerns that were only partially addressed during development.

Concorde	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The Aérospatiale/BAC <b>Concorde</b> (<span></span>) is a Franco-British supersonic airliner jointly developed and manufactured by Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Studies started in 1954, and France and the UK signed a treaty establishing the development project on 29 November 1962, as the programme cost was estimated at £70 million (£1.39 billion in 2020). Construction of the six prototypes began in February 1965, and the first flight took off from Toulouse on 2 March 1969. The market was predicted for 350 aircraft, and it received up to 100 options from many major airlines. On 9 October 1975, it received its French Certificate of Airworthiness, and from the UK CAA on 5 December.</p><p>Concorde is a tailless aircraft design with a narrow fuselage permitting a 4-abreast seating for 92 to 128 passengers, an ogival delta wing and a droop nose for landing visibility. It is powered by four Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 turbojets with variable engine intake ramps, and reheat for take-off and acceleration to supersonic speed. Constructed out of aluminium, it was the first airliner to have analogue fly-by-wire flight-controls. The airliner could maintain a supercruise up to Mach 2.04 (2,167 km/h; 1,170 kn) at an altitude of 60,000 ft (18.3 km). </p><p>Delays and cost overruns increased the programme cost to £1.5-2.1 billion in 1976, (£9.44 billion-13.2 billion in 2020). Concorde entered service on 21 January of that year with Air France from Paris-Roissy and British Airways from London Heathrow. Transatlantic flights was the main market, to Washington Dulles from 24 May, and to New York JFK from 17 October 1977. Air France and British Airways remained the sole customers with seven airframes each, for a total production of twenty. Supersonic flight more than halved travel times, but sonic booms over the ground limited it to transoceanic flights only. </p><p>Its only competitor was the Tupolev Tu-144, carrying passengers from November 1977 until a May 1978 crash, while the larger and faster Boeing 2707 was cancelled in 1971. On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590 ran over debris on its takeoff run and crashed with all 109 occupants and four on ground killed; the only fatal incident involving Concorde.

The Tu-144 was a product of the Tupolev Design Bureau, an OKB headed by aeronautics pioneer Aleksey Tupolev, and 16 aircraft were manufactured by the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association in Voronezh. The Tu-144 conducted 102 commercial flights, of which only 55 carried passengers, at an average service altitude of 16,000 metres (52,000 ft) and cruised at a speed of around 2,200 kilometres per hour (1,400 mph) (Mach 2). The Tu-144 first went supersonic on 5 June 1969, four months before Concorde, and on 26 May 1970 became the world's first commercial transport to exceed Mach 2.</p><p>Reliability and developmental issues, together with repercussions of the 1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash and rising fuel prices, restricted the viability of the Tu-144 for regular use. The Tu-144 was introduced into passenger service with Aeroflot between Moscow and Almaty on 26 December 1975, but withdrawn less than three years later after a second Tu-144 crashed on 23 May 1978. The Tu-144 remained in commercial service as a cargo aircraft until the cancellation of the Tu-144 program in 1983. The Tu-144 was later used by the Soviet space program to train pilots of the Buran spacecraft, and by NASA for supersonic research until 1999.

New Urbanism	"<p><b>New Urbanism</b> is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighbourhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies. New urbanism attempts to address the ills associated with urban sprawl and post-Second World War suburban development.</p><p>New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood development (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD). These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.</p> <p>The organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the <i>Charter of the New Urbanism</i>, which begins: </p> <blockquote class=""templatequote""><p>We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, ecology, and building practice.</p></blockquote> <p>New Urbanists support regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl. The <i>Charter of the New Urbanism</i> also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the re-development of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for New Urbanist approaches. </p><p>Architecturally, New Urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern, or vernacular styles, although that is not always the case.

Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during periods of high pollution or high fuel prices. Car sharing is a good way to use up the full seating capacity of a car, which would otherwise remain unused if it were just the driver using the car. </p><p>In 2009, carpooling represented 43.5% of all trips in the United States and 10% of commute trips. The majority of carpool commutes (over 60%) are ""fam-pools"" with family members.</p><p>Carpool commuting is more popular for people who work in places with more jobs nearby, and who live in places with higher residential densities. Carpooling is significantly correlated with transport operating costs, including fuel prices and commute length, and with measures of social capital, such as time spent with others, time spent eating and drinking and being unmarried.

Freight exchange	<p>A <b>freight exchange</b> is an online service for haulage companies, logistics providers, freight forwarders, transport companies and (in some cases) private customers. It allows haulage companies to search a database of available freight that needs to be delivered and advertise their available vehicle capacity. Logistics providers and freight forwarders can advertise their freight loads that need delivering and also match their freight loads to the available vehicle capacity. These systems provide a platform that allows carriers to communicate freight traffic information to fellow operators such as transporters, forwarders and logistics companies. They allow forwarders to advertise their freight either privately or publicly to a large number of freight operators that are looking for loads. They also allow freight operators to offer vehicle space. Online systems are often subscription-based with a small charge for advertising (posting) and searching (consulting). Some freight exchanges operate without monthly fees. They charge transport providers only a success fee, which is payable when the quote is accepted. </p><p>The main purpose of a freight exchange is to fill empty vehicles on their return journeys (when they are on their way back to their depot after a delivery) by matching them to available freight. </p><p>For example, a trucker has an order to transport tulips from Keukenhof in the Netherlands to Como, Italy. Ideally, a freight order for the return trip would increase profitability, so the trucker would search for return freight or return load on a freight exchange. </p><p>Finding return loads results in improved efficiency for haulage and transport companies as well as helping cut down on empty journeys, which reduces CO2 emissions. Transport is responsible for 25% of global emissions of greenhouse gases (including CO2) in the European Union. Around 24% of road freight journeys in the UK were empty in 2019.</p><p>The world's first electronic freight exchange was called Teleroute and was launched in France on the Minitel system in 1985. Before the Internet, users were supplied with a terminal to advertise or search for freight. Today, there are many examples around the world offering many services to haulers and freight forwarders. S </p><p>The classic freight exchange was a favorite tool in centralized economies. For example, there was a ban on driving with an empty truck in the socialist Czechoslovakia. Transport companies had to use the national system showing information about available loads. </p><p>With the help of new technology, freight exchanges are now able to improve efficiency even more by integrating with telematics and transport management systems to offer real-time freight load matching utilizing GPS technology.</p>	case offer these advertise tulip provider reduces czechoslovakia order france number more had fill would able also centralized by posting improve road are allows charge quote success large depot haulage co2 well from freight return can without wa socialist an union publicly be including trucker result classic helping national for subscriptionbased were ideally many fellow realtime company service search when emission that 25 private payable increase improved either carrier netherlands provide cut s online small efficiency hauler searching economy telematics allow often after need match such them integrating information profitability 24 they consulting operate help even advertising uk of finding before which traffic there truck is 2019the today communicate accepted terminal so now favorite looking on technology empty trip fee electronic it way minitel around about delivering space monthly vehicle launched operator some user showing global tool como customer load european supplied gps greenhouse main new a delivered their ban use forwarders or driving management example utilizing offering and down first exchange teleroute capacity database system the transporter to world called gas italy journey matching purpose available only keukenhof delivery logistics responsible internet ha 1985 back with platform in privately transport	freight internet exchange	internet freight exchange	Transport

Public transport	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Public transport</b> (also known as <b>public transportation</b>, <b>public transit</b>, <b>mass transit</b>, or simply <b>transit</b>) is a system of transport for passengers by group travel systems available for use by the general public unlike private transport, typically managed on a schedule, operated on established routes, and that charge a posted fee for each trip. There is no rigid definition; the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> specifies that public transportation is within urban areas, and air travel is often not thought of when discussing public transport—dictionaries use wording like ""buses, trains, etc."" Examples of public transport include city buses, trolleybuses, trams (or light rail) and passenger trains, rapid transit (metro/subway/underground, etc.) and ferries. Public transport between cities is dominated by airlines, coaches, and intercity rail. High-speed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world. </p><p>Most public transport systems run along fixed routes with set embarkation/disembarkation points to a prearranged timetable, with the most frequent services running to a headway (e.g.: ""every 15 minutes"" as opposed to being scheduled for any specific time of the day). However, most public transport trips include other modes of travel, such as passengers walking or catching bus services to access train stations. Share taxis offer on-demand services in many parts of the world, which may compete with fixed public transport lines, or complement them, by bringing passengers to interchanges. Paratransit is sometimes used in areas of low demand and for people who need a door-to-door service.</p><p>Urban public transit differs distinctly among Asia, North America, and Europe. In Asia, profit-driven, privately owned and publicly traded mass transit and real estate conglomerates predominantly operate public transit systems. In North America, municipal transit authorities most commonly run mass transit operations. In Europe, both state-owned and private companies predominantly operate mass transit systems. </p><p>For geographical, historical and economic reasons, differences exist internationally regarding use and extent of public transport. While countries in the Old World tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities, many cities of the New World have more sprawl and much less comprehensive public transport. The International Association of Public Transport (UITP) is the international network for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry. It has 3,400 members from 92 countries from all over the globe. </p><p>In recent years, some high-wealth cities have seen a decline in public transport usage. A number of sources attribute this trend to the rise in popularity of remote work, ride-sharing services, and car loans being relatively cheap across many countries. Major cities such as Toronto, Paris, Chicago, and London have seen this decline and have attempted to intervene by cutting fares and encouraging new modes of transportation, such as e-scooters and e-bikes. Because of the reduced emissions and other environmental impacts of using public transportation over private transportation, many experts have pointed to an increased investment in public transit as an important climate change mitigation tactic.</p>"	geographical investment offer operated serviceurban minute sometimes run distinctly most number unlike cutting more old posted train between commonly time also like used by real attribute reduced are charge europe comprehensive group compete other cheap fare member who from tram part walking urban popularity taxi conglomerate an include low 3400 this increased point bringing day headway mode publicly eg tactic area over for airline rail regarding much many economic recent etc thought usage major company when service london rigid emission change that encyclopædia scheduled private each while demand embarkationdisembarkation sprawl car among trolleybus municipal because dense association impact toronto typically light running simply frequent mass along industry often 15 route need managed such them extensive paris extent transport—dictionaries schedule highspeed however supply seen britannica city discussing ferry highwealth ebikes operate escooters expert year of uitp le environmental trend chicago transportation travel which decisionmakers attempted doortodoor there catching access both is set estate network share international globe on privately decline trip dominated fee america it source relatively bus difference line prearranged coach station operator some 92 air asia profitdriven fixed rapid exist stateowned complement loan ridesharing traded general wording a no transit definition use their new remote may encouraging being using all within or public policy every owned not predominantly example scientific have opposed and work intercity ondemand differs established specifies rise tend serving known climate system historical paratransit country the authority internationally pointed important metrosubwayunderground mitigation to world intervene interchange available any developed operation people ha with reason across specific north timetable institute in passenger transport	shared transportation service for use by the general public with fixed route or schedule	for the schedule transportation by or public with general service route use shared fixed	Transport

This is often achieved using the shared space approach, with greatly reduced demarcations between vehicle traffic and pedestrians. Vehicle parking may also be restricted to designated bays.

Sustainable transport	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1045330069""><p><b>Sustainable transport</b> refers to ways of transportation that are sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system. Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector. Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog.</p><p>Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility, with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options. The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose. Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimization.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided. Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon, a component of particulate matter, which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change. The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better air quality.</p><p>The social costs of transport include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity, time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people's time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services. Traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion. Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant, livable, sustainable cities. </p>"	option premature investment component these control family fossil adequately commuting aim poor more smogsustainable subject opportunity between proven time also real used by slowing crash term benefiting improve road are household mitigating connection sustainability group link increasing disease well other largely technique unep social who from measurement renewable part likely an doing include low development longterm promotes pollution waterway increased shortterm planning carcinogenic be alternative hazardous taken for many economic those change major service activity dioxide serve emission cause water that health involved reducing direct 25 drive congestion managing faster could each while million increase car local pose provide outdoor impact almost efficiency evaluation fossilbased 97 contributor contribution take consider often need such negative up estimate particulate wasting 24 they city disproportionately year of infrastructure environment thus environmental entire inactivity friend transportation greatly which traffic there access mobility is traditional avoided respiratory but network terminal sector so resource consumption on own migrating came evaluating particular cost matter good way source advantage life – weighed vehicle creating optimizationthe fall increasingly global air effectiveness energy community exist better death level significant accommodate at least vibrant goal greenhouse particularly nation their a accounting airway use may vulnerability being using 20 cycle measured simultaneously or public carbon have canal incremental and positive away majority quickly livable work improvement burning make fuel known sustainable climate wider system rate the united railway against than to fail transitoriented world gas improving especially black purpose imposes any programme level—both operation delivery logistics education people program successfully with offered physical through price in qualitythe transport refers	broad subject of transport that is sustainable in the senses of social, environmental and climate impacts and the ability to, in the global scope, supply the source energy indefinitely	in is that subject indefinitely and ability source climate impact sustainable the broad to global social energy scope supply sens of environmental transport	Transport

This objective is achieved by restricting traffic access into an urban cordon area, city center (CBD), or district based upon the last digits of the license number on pre-established days and during certain periods, usually, the peak hours. </p><p>The practical implementation of this traffic restraint policy is common in Latin America, and in many cases, the road rationing has as a main goal the reduction of air pollution, such as the cases of México City, and Santiago, Chile. São Paulo, with a fleet of 6 million vehicles in 2007, is the largest metropolis in the world with such a travel restriction, implemented first in 1996 as measured to mitigate air pollution, and thereafter made permanent in 1997 to relieve traffic congestion. More recent implementations in Costa Rica and Honduras have had the objective of reducing oil consumption, due to the high impact this import has on the economy of small countries, and considering the steep increases in oil prices that began in 2003. Bogotá, Quito, and La Paz, Bolivia also have similar driving restriction schemes in place. </p><p>After a temporary implementation of road space rationing to reduce air pollution in Beijing during the 2008 Summer Olympics, local officials put in place several permanent rationing schemes to improve the city's air quality. As of June 2016, another 11 Chinese cities have similar restriction schemes in place. Also, temporary driving restrictions to reduce cars on the streets by half during severe pollution events have been implemented in Paris and surrounding suburbs in March 2014, March 2015, and December 2016; in Beijing twice in December 2015, and one more time in December 2016; and also in Rome and Milan for several days in December 2015.

They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts. </p><p>The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or ""safety bicycle"", has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design.

People engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"", ""bicyclists"", or ""bikers"". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). </p><p>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world, especially in densely populated European cities.</p><p>Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances. </p><p>Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion. These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.</p><p>In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles. Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery. Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.</p><p>Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles, often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances. </p>"	bikers offer these quadricycles fossil order number sport stress protection cyclist humanpowered hpvs century short time also used by crash surgery society road reduced are rack large vitalityamong fact disease well front who regarded from disadvantage part required riding can benefit principal motor populated an possible includes financial referred sedentary fitness pollution increased perceived mode effective densely be including area sustained rider engaged for were negligible provides many efficient mental remain reported unicycle emission congestion health that involved excepting path upright prevalent increase stationary tricycle billion provide diabetes distance cycling except individual basic balanced injury after biking often rural difficulty they comparison regularly citiescycling been of le lifestyle transportation parking greatly travel traffic lower transporting access is addition trail numerous now consumption on damage cost introduced moderate bus bicycling apart 19th servein organization risk similar vehicle user air easier significantly approximately optimal limb better state level european at maneuverability greenhouse particularly a worldwide transit heart use long mean hip recumbent vulnerability cycle reduce bicycle or noise requirement variety have cancer exercise and one improvement widely fuel weather the twowheeled rehabilitation condition to called world gas especially bicyclist longer bike fitting recreation people with physical in agency passenger transport	riding a bicycle (transportation, sport, exercise, recreation...)	transportation bicycle recreation a sport riding exercise	Transport
Tram	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>tram</b> (also known as a <b>streetcar</b>, <b>tramcar</b>, <b>trolley</b> or <b>trolleycar</b> in North America) is a train that runs on a tramway track on public urban streets; some include segments on segregated right-of-way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars as public transport are called tramways or simply tram/streetcar. Many recently built tramways use the contemporary term light rail. The vehicles are called streetcars or trolleys (not to be confused with trolleybus) in North America and trams or tramcars elsewhere. The first two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States, with <i>trolley</i> being the preferred term in the eastern US and <i>streetcar</i> in the western US. <i>Streetcar</i> or <i>tramway</i> are preferred in Canada. In parts of the United States, internally powered buses made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as ""trolleys"". To avoid further confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as ""trolley-replica buses"". In the United States, the term <i>tram</i> has sometimes been used for rubber-tired trackless trains, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams. </p><p>Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than main line and rapid transit trains. Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a pantograph sliding on an overhead line; older systems may use a trolley pole or a bow collector. In some cases, a contact shoe on a third rail is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems—electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry freight. Trams are now commonly included in the wider term ""light rail"", which also includes grade-separated systems. Some trams, known as tram-trains, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to interurban systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features. </p><p>Ultra Light Rail ULR trains are trams are a developing light weight rail type, around &lt;5T/axle (empty), for use in smaller cities and towns to replace main bus routes eg. Coventry Very Light Rail, ULR Partners future-light-rail or lower use branch train lines. They may be normal trams, rail motor sized and/or smaller modular units capable of platooning. They offer all the advantages of traditional trams but their lower weight, prefabricated beam type tracks offer the possibility of avoiding costly services diversions, lightweight OHL Over Head Lines and/or onboard power options eg. hydrogen, biomethane, battery, may mean reduced/eliminated OHL. Thus installation costs may be lower than traditional trains and trams. </p><p>One of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low rolling resistance of metal wheels on steel rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Problems included the high total cost of ownership of horses. Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in the mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence in recent years. In 2014, the Aubagne tramway in Southern France became the first tram system in the world not to charge fares.</p>"	case option powered systems—electricity these operated offer occasionally sometimes run 2014 american most france replace interchangeably fed more multiple type century beam train between commonly confused also bow used by costly early term made lightweight street are modular charge overhead tramtrains other unit largely fare tramstreetcar tram part freight normal urban wa motor an includes include referred trolleyreplica futurelightrail low andor earlier horse segregated mode be lt5taxle eg over installation resurgence town built for smaller rail sliding many very recent allowing biomethane prefabricated service platooning that canada older apta third form given trolleybus association mainline rubbertired light simply pole high resistance trolley often route rural two them such tramcar weight kind ulr however they city seen late partner been trackless indistinct year of preferred environment thus gradeseparated led transportation southern which rolling lower diversion haul is traditional today total network but shorter now ultra replaced on included streetcar confusion lighter carry effort decline empty cost america hydrogen sized bus metal difference advantage line eastern around avoiding 19th track similar feature electric vehicle some steel aubagne rightofway battery usually head rapid state load u combine main further tramway a power transit dual use their animal may mean problem being pantograph trolleycar capable all diesel or public western contact not contemporary have and one first if improvement developing avoid branch known electrical wider interurban system unrelated united the railway resemble than to called world onboard segment reducedeliminated possibility necessary ohl coventry 20th ownership ha shoe with elsewhere internally recently collector mid north wheel became in greater transport refers	public transport vehicle running on rails predominantly located on streets	on rail vehicle public predominantly street running transport located	Transport
Smart growth	"<p><b>Smart growth</b> is an urban planning and transportation theory that concentrates growth in compact walkable urban centers to avoid sprawl. It also advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land use, including neighborhood schools, complete streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices. The term ""smart growth"" is particularly used in North America. In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms ""compact city"", ""urban densification"" or ""urban intensification"" have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries. </p><p>Smart growth values long-range, regional considerations of sustainability over a short-term focus.

High-occupancy vehicle lane	<p>A <b>high-occupancy vehicle lane</b> (also known as an <b>HOV lane</b>, <b>carpool lane</b>, <b>diamond lane</b>, <b>2+ lane</b>, and <b>transit lane</b> or <b>T2 or T3 lanes</b>) is a restricted traffic lane reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses. These restrictions may be only imposed during peak travel times or may apply at all times. According to the criteria used there are different types of lanes: temporary or permanent with concrete barriers; two-directional or reversible; and exclusive, concurrent or contraflow lanes working in peak periods. The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll. HOV lanes are normally introduced to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, although their effectiveness is questionable.</p><p>Regional and corporate-sponsored vanpools, carpools, and rideshare communities give commuters a way to increase occupancy. For places without such services, online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose. Slugging lines are common in some places, where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow them to use the HOV lane. High-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes), which allow solo driver vehicles to use HOV lanes on payment of a fee which varies depending on demand, have also been introduced in the United States and Canada. </p>	singleoccupancy normally these reserved give more type corporatesponsored time also used are diamond other apply driver where hov normal can lane without an andor pollution lowemission vanpools including be according temporary for criterion many carpools jurisdiction service reducing average serve congestion canada restricted increase place demand contraflow charter online slugging highoccupancy restriction allow such them up barrier carpool been of travel which traffic payment there is hot share concurrent concrete commuter on occupant fee introduced way bus rideshare t2 solo line similar vehicle period some different air effectiveness law community level state imposed at exempt questionableregional paying goal pick a their transit ride use peak may toll all or occupancy emergency enforcement have person depending and twodirectional one motorcycle t3 green 2 although known united the to permanent common during traveling 3 reversible purpose only varies with working minimum in passenger exclusive	restricted traffic lane	restricted lane traffic	Transport
Electric vehicle	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>An <b>electric vehicle</b> (<b>EV</b>)<b></b> is an automotive vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. It can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or it can be powered autonomously by a battery (sometimes charged by solar panels, or by converting fuel to electricity using fuel cells or a generator). EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft. </p><p>EVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Internal combustion engines were the dominant propulsion method for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but electric power remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types. </p><p>In the 21st century, EVs have seen a resurgence due to technological developments, and an increased focus on renewable energy and the potential reduction of transportation's impact on climate change, air pollution, and other environmental issues. Project Drawdown describes electric vehicles as one of the 100 best contemporary solutions for addressing climate change.</p><p>Government incentives to increase adoption were first introduced in the late 2000s, including in the United States and the European Union, leading to a growing market for the vehicles in the 2010s. Increasing public interest and awareness and structural incentives, such as those being built into the green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to greatly increase the electric vehicle market. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have reduced the amount of greenhouse gases from gasoline or diesel vehicles. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that governments should do more to meet climate goals, including policies for heavy electric vehicles. Electric vehicle sales may increase from 2% of global share in 2016 to 30% by 2030. Much of this growth is expected in markets like North America, Europe and China; a 2020 literature review suggested that growth in use of electric 4-wheeled vehicles appears economically unlikely in developing economies, but that electric 2-wheeler growth is likely. There are more 2 and 3 wheel EVs than any other type.</p>"	powered charged sometimes pandemic 2020 technological us aircraft expected more type century train time like by surface mid19th adoption sale road reduced are europe increasing other 2030 from describes renewable can wa motor likely an include comfort due development this union pollution increased method leading recovery be resurgence including solar built should economically for smaller rail were unlikely much said those project change when appears incentive autonomously that best 2021 potential remained could vessel spacecraft increase awareness car covid19 review among impact extravehicular electricity 2016 economy addressing drawdown such 21st cell automotive seen achieved late underwater generator year of preferred 100 environmental propulsion ease transportation greatly there truck is 30 literature but share engine international on came 2010s america introduced it source growth commonplace interest government focus internal solution about electric vehicle do providing global air china battery energy level state european market converting growing goal combustion greenhouse a power use may being using all issue structural diesel limited or into public policy changegovernment 4wheeled not contemporary have suggested and amount panel one first green meet 2 fuel reduction developing climate system 2wheeler united the than to existence gas gasoline during 3 any operation heavy lockdown ev with dominant collector north wheel in agency 2000s	vehicle propelled by one or more electric motors	one by electric vehicle or more motor propelled	Transport
Bus rapid transit	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Bus rapid transit</b> (<b>BRT</b>), also called a <b>busway</b> or <b>transitway</b>, is a bus-based public transport system designed to have better capacity and reliability than a conventional bus system.

Induced demand	"<p><b>Induced demand</b> – related to <b>latent demand</b> and <b>generated demand</b> – is the phenomenon whereby an increase in supply results in a decline in price and an increase in consumption. In other words, as a good/service becomes more readily available and mass produced, the price of a good/service goes down and consumers are more likely to buy it, meaning demand subsequently increases. This is consistent with the economic theory of supply and demand. </p><p>In transportation planning, induced demand, also called ""induced traffic"" or consumption of road capacity, has become important in the debate over the expansion of transportation systems, and is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity as a cure for congestion. Induced traffic may be a contributing factor to urban sprawl. City planner Jeff Speck has called induced demand ""the great intellectual black hole in city planning, the one professional certainty that every thoughtful person seems to acknowledge, yet almost no one is willing to act upon.""</p><p>The inverse effect, or <b>reduced demand</b>, is also observed (see § Reduced demand). </p>"	observed intellectual more latent debate word also used generated become road reduced are consumer consistent uponthe increasing other cure go urban likely an readily this great thoughtful be over result for economic hole planning congestion that yet related acknowledge increase produced demand goodservice sprawl effect almost jeff mass often subsequently supply city of whereby transportation phenomenon meaning traffic willing is certainty consumption decline induced contributing it – theory speck planner argument act a no may § buy or expansion every person and down factor inverse one professional seems becomes capacity roadway system the important against to called black available ha with price see in	transport economics term	term economics transport	Transport

Sixth form college	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>sixth form college</b> is an educational institution, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as A Levels, Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or school-level qualifications such as General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations. In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase 'sixth form college' as the English name for a lycée (Highschool).</p><p>In England and the Caribbean, education is currently compulsory until the end of Year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18. In the English state educational system, pupils may either stay at a secondary school with an attached sixth form, transfer to a local sixth form college, or go to a more vocational further education college, although in some places there may in practice be little choice which of these options can be taken. Some places only provide tertiary colleges, a ""combination"" between sixth form and further education colleges. In the independent sector, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools (public schools), and there is also a number of smaller-scale independent sixth form colleges. In Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of year 11. </p><p>Students at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 12 and 13 – Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland – or lower sixth and upper sixth). Some students sit AS examinations at the end of the first year, and A-level examinations at the end of the second. These exams are called C.A.P.E. (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in the Caribbean. In addition, in recent years a variety of vocational courses have been added to the curriculum. </p><p>There are currently over 90 sixth form colleges in England and Wales. Most of these perform extremely well in national examination league tables. In addition, they offer a broader range of courses at a lower cost per student than most school sixth forms. In a few areas, authorities run sixth form schools which function like sixth form colleges but are completely under the control of the local education authorities.

University press	<p>A <b>university press</b> is an academic publishing house specializing in monographs and scholarly journals. Most are nonprofit organizations and an integral component of a large research university. They publish work that has been reviewed by scholars in the field. They produce mainly academic works but also often have trade books for a lay audience. These trade books also get peer reviewed. Because scholarly books are mostly unprofitable, university presses may also publish textbooks and reference works, which tend to have larger audiences and sell more copies. Most university presses operate at a loss and are subsidized by their owners; others are required to break even. Demand has fallen as library budgets are cut and the online sales of used books undercut the new book market. Many presses are experimenting with electronic publishing.</p>	component these academic most more also budget by used book integral sale specializing are large unprofitable university library required an press loss textbook for lay undercut many scholar others that journal copy because demand cut online often reviewed they experimenting larger operate even been of which is but produce monograph sell audience electronic organization subsidized break market at mainly new a their owner may scholarly in mostly nonprofit have reference and work research tend fallen trade the to publishing publish ha with get peer house field	publisher associated with a university	university with publisher a associated	Universities_and_colleges

Theodore Streleski	"<p><b>Theodore Landon ""Ted"" Streleski</b> (b. 1936) is an American former graduate student in mathematics at Stanford University who murdered his former faculty advisor, Professor Karel de Leeuw, with a ball-peen hammer on August 18, 1978. Shortly after the murder, Streleski turned himself in to the authorities, claiming he felt the murder was justifiable homicide because de Leeuw had withheld departmental awards from him, demeaned Streleski in front of his peers, and refused his requests for financial support. Streleski was in his 19th year pursuing his doctorate in the mathematics department, alternating with low-paying jobs to support himself.</p><p>During his trial Streleski told the court he felt the murder was ""logically and morally correct"" and ""a political statement"" about the department's treatment of its graduate students, and he forced his court-appointed lawyer to enter a plea of ""not guilty"" rather than ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" as the lawyer had urged. Streleski was convicted of second degree murder with a sentence of eight years. He served seven years in prison at California Medical Facility.</p><p>Streleski was eligible for parole on three occasions, but turned it down as the conditions of his parole required him to get psychiatric treatment. Upon his release in 1985, he said, ""I have no intention of killing again.

2020 Jawaharlal Nehru University attack	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>On 5 January 2020, more than 50 masked people armed with rods, sticks and acid attacked the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and injured more than 39 students and teachers. Many students received serious injuries. Professors who tried to intervene and protect the students, as well as ambulances carrying injured individuals, were attacked. Eyewitnesses stated that police within the campus did not intervene to stop the mob. After attacking residents of the university campus for three hours, the mob escaped; none of its members was arrested or detained. All 36 students who were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (AIIMS) were discharged within 24 hours.</p><p>Eyewitnesses, including students injured in the attack, as well as opposition parties and left-wing organizations, accused the members of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) student wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) of orchestrating the attacks. The ABVP, a Hindu nationalist organization, initially denied any involvement and accused left-wing organisations of carrying out the attack. On 6 January, ABVP's joint secretary for Delhi, Anima Sonkar, admitted on television that two armed men seen in videos of the incident were members of ABVP. Although any one clear motive has not emerged, the attack has been described by some as a way to prevent students from raising their voice against a fee hike and the Citizenship Amendment Act.</p><p>Police have said that three of the masked attackers have been identified but no arrests have been made, and complaints have been filed as a single FIR (First Information Report) on unknown people. On 15 January, police confirmed the identification of the masked woman, seen in the video recording of the attack, as a member of ABVP. Police have issued a notice to the woman and two other men.

Graduate school	"<p>A <b>graduate school</b> (sometimes shortened to <b>grad school</b>) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (e.g., master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, speech–language pathology, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa. </p><p>Many universities award graduate degrees; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution. While the term ""graduate school"" is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere (e.g., Canada), ""postgraduate education"" is also used in English-speaking countries (Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and the UK) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor's degree. Those attending graduate schools are called ""graduate students"" (in both American and British English), or often in British English as ""postgraduate students"" and, colloquially, ""postgraduates"" and ""postgrads"". Degrees awarded to graduate students include master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees. </p><p>Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. This research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation. In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training (e.g., MPA, MBA, MHA), the degrees may consist solely of coursework, without an original research or thesis component. The term ""graduate school"" is primarily North American. Additionally, in North America, the term does not usually refer to medical school (whose students are called ""medical students""), and only occasionally refers to law school or business school; these are often collectively termed professional schools. Graduate students in the humanities, sciences and social sciences often receive funding from the school (e.g., fellowships or scholarships) or a teaching assistant position or other job; in the profession-oriented grad programs, students are less likely to get funding, and the fees are typically much higher. </p><p>Although graduate school programs are distinct from undergraduate degree programs, graduate instruction (in the US, Australia, and other countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses. Unlike in undergraduate programs, however, it is less common for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level. At the Ph.D. level, though, it is quite common to take courses from a wider range of study, for which some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as a <i>residency</i>, is typically required to be taken from outside the department and college of the degree-seeking candidate, to broaden the research abilities of the student. </p>"	offer component these higher occasionally instruction sometimes academic staff american master department whose certificate unlike spectrum between africa producing absolute also used by writing term made postgrads coursework are consist distinct course engineering university must distinction other collectively scholarship who social where from earned profession required solely mpa without likely an range india zealand include candidate since this doe nursing same defense eg be british vice fellowship degree for bangladesh taken student advanced much many professionoriented those versa entry training natural english that teach canada school necessarily while ability postgraduate additionally provide typically mha specialized college job funding previous take grad often such medical though assistant teaching however they undergraduate business uk of le senior which primarily both is englishspeaking separate oriented doctoral graduate particular award fee america south quite lead it portion institution australia outside shortened pakistan pathology phd awarded some broaden medicine degreeseeking law qualification usually fixed state original significant level at u new general a their may science thesis beyond colloquially humanity or requirement not have and various receive professional research attending although toward known wider country refer vary the united bachelor to position called dissertation mba common typical residency only education program study with elsewhere ireland get offered termed north speech–language specific in field refers	school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree	ie advanced student academic requirement master have that doctoral and school award the bachelor must previous earned undergraduate with general a degree	Universities_and_colleges

Grutter v. Bollinger	"<p><i><b>Grutter v. Bollinger</b></i>, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), was a landmark case of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning affirmative action in student admissions. The Court held that a student admissions process that favors ""underrepresented minority groups"" does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause so long as it takes into account other factors evaluated on an individual basis for every applicant. </p><p>The case arose after a prospective student to the University of Michigan Law School alleged that she had been denied admission because the school gave certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission. The school admitted that its admission process favored certain minority groups, but argued that there was a compelling state interest to ensure a ""critical mass"" of students from minority groups. In a majority opinion joined by four other justices, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor held that the Constitution ""does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."" </p><p>In her majority opinion, O'Connor wrote that ""race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time,"" adding that the ""Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment, but did not subscribe to the belief that the affirmative measures in question would be unnecessary in 25 years. In a dissent joined by three other justices, Chief Justice William Rehnquist argued that the university's admissions system was, in fact, a thinly veiled and unconstitutional quota system. </p><p>The decision largely upheld the Court's decision in <i>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</i> (1978), which allowed race to be a consideration in admissions policy but held racial quotas to be unconstitutional. In <i>Gratz v. Bollinger</i> (2003) a separate case decided on the same day as <i>Grutter</i>, the Court struck down a points-based admissions system that awarded an automatic bonus to the admissions scores of minority applicants. </p>"	fourteenth case her v protection michigan had quota would admission time joined by decided ruth upheld bollinger group university narrowly breyer must fact other largely from minority arose educational wa benefit favored an veiled account doe day 1978 decision same basis clause chance be for violate stephen student concerning diverse prospective will gave that held 25 expects preference school william allowed regent raceconscious admitted because opinion amendment obtaining struck individual certain she gratz take alleged critical mass 539 after affirmative prohibit approved rehnquist court argued been year concurred of unnecessary action adding bader three which there applicant today bakke but judgment so compelling now grutter on separate four chief it pointsbased interest question landmark belief awarded 306 wrote unconstitutional law significantly automatic consideration ensure state u score further a no underrepresented use long denied evaluated into policy limited every not ginsburg and factor did majority constitution down favor supreme subscribe process sandra 2003 justice system tailored united the bonus race to california body flow necessary equal longer measure racial oconnor dissent thinly in greater	2003 United States Supreme Court case	case state supreme 2003 court united	Universities_and_colleges
Regents of the University of California v. Bakke	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</b></i>, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy. However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, were impermissible. </p><p>Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved. Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, <i>DeFunis v. Odegaard</i> (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds. </p><p>Allan P. Bakke (<span></span>), an engineer and former Marine officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission due in part to his age. Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, and therefore considered too old by at least two institutions. After twice being rejected by the University of California, Davis, he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the school's affirmative action program. The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention. </p><p>The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. The practical effect of <i>Bakke</i> was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the <i>Bakke</i> case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in <i>Grutter v.

Wait list	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Wait list</b>, in university and college admissions, is a term used in the United States and other countries to describe a situation in which a college or university has not formally accepted a particular student for admission, but at the same time may offer admission in the next few months if spaces become available. It is a contingent offer only, and may mean an offer of admission in the future, or it may not, depending on circumstances. It has been described as a type of college admissions ""purgatory"", or being held in ""the higher-ed equivalent of limbo"". The percent of applicants offered admission, who decide to accept, is known as the <i>admissions yield</i>, and this proportion varies somewhat from year to year, and reflects economic conditions as well as interest in a given university. </p><p>Colleges mailing out wait list offers generally advise students to reserve a spot at a college they have been accepted to by sending in a deposit, usually several hundred dollars to guarantee that the student will have a place at any college in the fall. Later, if a student is accepted by a college from a wait list, and if he or she chooses to accept the wait list offer, it usually entails sacrificing that earlier deposit. In the United States, for students applying by regular admission, the month of April is a time when much activity happens; colleges email offers of acceptance and rejection, and students select a college by sending a deposit. In May, after receiving deposits, colleges know how many spots will be open, and will usually begin to offer admission to students on their wait lists as positions become open. Students can be offered admission from the wait list during May and June and throughout the summer. </p><p>According to several reports, colleges and universities use wait lists to try to hedge their guesses about how many students will ultimately decide to accept their offers of admission in any given academic year, with the idea being to build ""a reservoir of qualified students to draw from to replace successful applicants who choose to go elsewhere."" If fewer students say yes, then colleges will often go to their wait lists to try to find replacements. In 2010, according to one source, roughly 10% of college applicants were put on a wait list.</p><p>Wait lists tend to be used by elite and selective universities as well as second-tier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall; for example, Stanford and Yale put 1,000 students on their wait lists and Duke put 3,000 on their wait list, according to one report in 2010. Amherst takes 35 students from the 1,000 students on its wait list. And as a general rule, selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of wait list. Of the students on a wait list at a highly selective school, a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late August or September. One report said the fraction of wait-listed students who were eventually offered admission––as an average of all students wait listed in a given year––was 30%, but this is an overall average, and the fraction of wait-listed applicants to prestigious universities, who are eventually admitted, is much less. Students who are wait-listed can take steps to improve their chances of admission from a wait list by writing letters of interest and by sending second-semester senior grades. Wait listed students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability, based on the college's estimation of admissions criteria, and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open; this ranking is not revealed to the public. </p>"	offer guess academic throughout proportion accept department successful replace happens type more reserve june admission spot time used by writing letter term become improve yield ultimately are admission––as secondsemester future duke university other well draw situation who from open go can an highered selective august this earlier yale he next same chance advise be according rejection several begin for were student criterion much many highly said economic acceptance will say when activity replacement month average hedge that held purgatory choose school later guarantee put form limbo given place admitted described somewhat college roughly she rule eventually take select after often up overall entail they grade late dollar sending percent been year generally of 3000 le senior decide before which applicant is then 30 secondtier fraction but find accepted on ranked list ranking wait particular april report desirability it source interest know about space 2010 fall qualified out some based usually september class state amherst at listwait listed chooses general a their 1000 use reservoir art revealed circumstance mean may build describe being summer reflects idea all stanford or formally public email 10 not example liberal have depending and fewer deposit one first if mailing estimation applying tend known country uncertain united the receiving condition step elite to position prestigious contingent during equivalent yes year––was show available only any hundred varies how try 35 ha few sacrificing with elsewhere offered regular in waitlisted	college admission circumstance where an applicant has not been accepted but may be if room opens	an admission college if ha applicant open been where not be but room accepted circumstance may	Universities_and_colleges
Yield (college admissions)	<p><b>Yield</b> in college admissions is the percent of students who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission. It is calculated by dividing the number of students who choose to enroll at a school in a given year, which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit, by the total number of offers of acceptance sent. A higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education. The yield rate is usually calculated once per year based on admissions statistics. As a statistical measure, it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity, such that a higher yield rate is a sign of a more selective college. For example, the yield rate for Princeton University was 69% in 2016, while the yield rate for Dartmouth was 55%, and the yield rate for Colorado College was 37%. The yield rate has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs; in 2001, a report in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> by reporter Daniel Golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or wait list well-qualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll, as a way to boost the college's overall yield rate; according to the report, these actions are part of an effort to improve a college's scores on the US News college ranking. This practice is known as yield protection. </p>	offer higher staff rating these sometimes department number assumption protection pay more subject admission used by improve yield street are university who wall part wa an selective selectivity this 2001 news decision according for per student statistic acceptance will service enroll that choose school journal while given boost college statistical 2016 dividing after often such overall they 55 percent been year of action which applicant is total enrolling on list effort ranking wait particular report it way 69 interest colorado having reporter 37 calculated wellqualified some based usually at u score a their indicates reject princeton once dartmouth being golden or criticized not example manipulation suggested and deposit practice sign known sent rate the to daniel measure education ha offered in greater	the percent of students who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission	student or enroll admission choose particular the college having university to who after percent been a offered of in	Universities_and_colleges

Open-door academic policy	<p>An <b>open-door academic policy</b>, or <b>open-door policy</b>, is a policy if a university accepting to enroll students without asking for evidence of previous education, experience, or references. Usually, payment of the academic fees (or financial support) is all that is required to enroll. </p><p>Universities may not employ the open-door policy for all their courses, and those that have a universal open-door policy where all courses have no entry requirements are called <i>open universities</i>. The policy is sometimes characterized as a part of an educational revolution. From the dictionary meaning of the <i>open-door policy</i>, which is the idea of granting access to all those who want access, a similar idea can be drawn in terms of education.</p><p>According to Deepa Rao, the open-door academic policy is one of the main ways in which adult learners become a part of university/college life.

Early entrance to college	<p><b>Early entrance to college</b>, sometimes called <b>early admission</b> or <b>early enrollment</b>, is the practice of allowing high school students to be accelerated into college, one or more years before the traditional age of college entrance, and without obtaining a high school diploma. In some cases this is done individually. Often, however, it is done as part of a cohort acceleration program, in which many such students are accelerated into college together at the same time. These programs are usually targeted to gifted students, and may provide their students with a social support network and help in dealing with the adjustment. </p><p>By placing students into full-time college studies, early entrance differs from dual enrollment, early college high school, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced International Certificate of Education programs, which are alternative methods of earned college credits (or their equivalent) while in high school. </p><p>Early entrance programs take a number of forms. Some, like the Advanced Academy of Georgia and The Clarkson School, are special programs within larger colleges. In others, like the early entrance program at Shimer College, the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted at Mary Baldwin University, and the Early Entrance Program at CSULA, early entrants study side-by-side with traditional college students. Bard College at Simon's Rock is the only four-year college designed exclusively for younger students.

DeFunis v. Odegaard	"<p><i><b>DeFunis v. Odegaard</b></i>, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the case had become moot and so declined to render a decision on the merits. American student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law in the state of Washington before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to graduate within a few months of the decision being rendered.</p><p>The Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the plaintiff. The case did not constitute ""voluntary cessation"" on the part of the defendant law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review. </p><p>DeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's affirmative action policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in <i>DeFunis</i>, the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in <i>Regents of the University of California v.

Students are notified of the school's decision by early January instead of mid-March or May 1. </p><p>In this way, it is similar to many colleges' Early Decision (ED) programs. Some colleges offer both ED and EA. ED, however, is a binding commitment to enroll; that is, if accepted under ED, the applicant must withdraw all other applications and enroll at that institution. Thus, ED does not allow applicants to apply to more than one ED school simultaneously. Early Action, on the other hand, allows candidates to decline the offer if accepted, and depending on the program, it <i>may</i> be possible for a candidate to apply to one or more EA schools, plus one ED school. EA can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school since a student will know the result of the application sooner, and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools.</p>	offer ea unlike more type early admission by are allows university must instead other apply who plus from can compare an possible candidate choice this since doe decision be january result for ed student application many will hand enroll best that aid school sooner college high allow extent however they year of thus action senior commitment withdraw midmarch both applicant is accepted submit on decline particular it way institution know similar november some different binding usually state requires at prefer under a their may all simultaneously or varying 1 not depending and one if process united the midoctober to than notified program offered regular in	type of university early admission process	early admission university process of type	Universities_and_colleges

Early decision	<p><b>Early decision</b> (<b>ED</b>) or <b>early acceptance</b> is a type of early admission used in college admissions in the United States for admitting freshmen to undergraduate programs. It is used to indicate to the university or college that the candidate considers that institution to be their top choice through a binding commitment to enroll (i.e., if offered admission under an ED program, and the financial aid offered by the school is acceptable, the candidate must enroll at that institution and withdraw all applications to other institutions). Applying early decision brings a greater statistical chance of being accepted. </p><p>Candidates applying early decision typically submit their applications mid-October to early November of their senior year of high school and receive a decision around mid-December. In contrast, students applying regular decision typically must submit their applications by January 1 and receive their admissions decision by April 1. Students can know sooner where they will attend, removing uncertainty and the need for multiple applications and the associated costs. </p><p>Typically, a candidate who has applied early decision can receive one of three outcomes in December. They may be admitted (bound to attend the school which admitted them), rejected (they will not be able to attend the school), or deferred (they will be reconsidered for admission with the second round of early decision applications or with the regular decision pool and notified later with their final decision). Generally, when an applicant is deferred, they are released from their binding commitment. </p>	december contrast released type multiple early admission reconsidered able used by are university must rejected other deferred who where from can financial an candidate choice decision chance be january ed for ie student application acceptance will admitting when brings enroll that aid school later admitted typically sooner college statistical high freshman need them they undergraduate applied year pool of generally three senior commitment final uncertainty withdraw which applicant is round accepted acceptable submit attend bound april cost it removing institution know around november binding state at under a their may being all or 1 not considers top and receive one indicate if applying second united the midoctober to notified outcome middecember program ha with offered regular through associated in greater	College admissions policy	policy admission college	Universities_and_colleges

UCAS Tariff	<p>The <b>UCAS Tariff</b> (formerly called <b>UCAS Points System</b>) is used to allocate points to post-16 qualifications (Level 3 qualifications on the Regulated Qualifications Framework). Universities and colleges may use it when making offers to applicants. A points total is achieved by converting qualifications such as A levels (and many others) into points, making it simpler for course providers to compare applicants. It is used as a means of giving students from the United Kingdom places at UK universities. </p><p>Common ways for UCAS points to be calculated are through the UCAS Tariff Calculator, official tariff tables, or through third-party software and websites. </p><p>The UCAS Tariff was first introduced in 2001. Since then, however, both the range of qualifications held by applicants, and the variety of progression routes into higher education have increased. Therefore a new Tariff was introduced. The new UCAS Tariff points are based on a different methodology. The change to new UCAS Tariff will not in itself change entry requirements for university or college courses. Universities and colleges are independent organisations and each year they decide how to set their entry requirements.

2019 college admissions bribery scandal	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>In 2019, a scandal arose over a criminal conspiracy to influence undergraduate admissions decisions at several top American universities. The investigation into the conspiracy was code named <b>Operation Varsity Blues</b>. The investigation and related charges were made public on March 12, 2019, by United States federal prosecutors. At least 53 people have been charged as part of the conspiracy, a number of whom pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty. Thirty-three parents of college applicants are accused of paying more than $25<span> </span>million between 2011 and 2018 to <b>William Rick Singer</b>, organizer of the scheme, who used part of the money to fraudulently inflate entrance exam test scores and bribe college officials.</p><p>Singer controlled the two firms involved in the scheme, Key Worldwide Foundation and The Edge College &amp; Career Network (also known as ""The Key""). He pleaded guilty and cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in gathering incriminating evidence against co-conspirators. He said he unethically facilitated college admission for children in more than 750 families. Singer faces up to 65 years in prison, and a fine of $1.25<span> </span>million. </p><p>Prosecutors in the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, led by United States Attorney Andrew Lelling, unsealed indictments and complaints for felony conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud against 50 people, including Singer, who has been ""portrayed [...] as a criminal mastermind"", university staff he bribed, and parents who are alleged to have used bribery and fraud to secure admission for their children to 11 universities. Among the accused parents are prominent business-people and well-known actors. Those charges have a maximum term of 20 years in prison, supervised release of three years, and a $250,000 fine. One month later, 16 of the parents were also indicted by prosecutors for alleged felony conspiracy to commit money laundering. This third charge has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, supervised release of three years, and a $500,000 fine. </p><p>The investigation's name, Operation Varsity Blues, comes from a 1999 film of the same name.

Need-blind admission	<p><b>Need-blind admission</b> is a term used in the United States denoting a college admission policy in which an institution does not consider an applicant's financial situation when deciding admission. This policy generally increases the proportion of admitted students needing financial aid and often requires the institution to back the policy with an ample endowment or other sources of funding. Being need-blind is a statutory requirement for institutions to participate in an antitrust exemption granted by Congress which remains in effect until September 30, 2022. An institution may be need-blind in any given year by policy (de jure) or by circumstances (de facto). </p><p>Most colleges and universities cannot afford to offer adequate financial aid to all admitted students; some are not need-blind while others admit students on a need-blind basis but do not offer them sufficient aid to meet their full demonstrated financial need. In addition, many schools that admit domestic first-year students without regard to need do not extend this policy to international or transfer students. Schools that are need-blind and meet full need for all applicants are usually very selective as they tend to receive more applications than other schools. </p><p>Institutions set their own definition of meeting the full demonstrated need. There is no universal standard that an institution must abide by to claim that it meets full demonstrated need. Additionally, some institutions meet full demonstrated need entirely through grants, merit scholarships, and/or talent scholarships, whereas others include loans that need to be repaid and/or work-study directly at the college campus in addition to the other forms of financial aid. For these reasons, an admitted student's financial aid package can vary significantly at different schools that all claim to meet full demonstrated need. </p> 	deciding remains offer these workstudy proportion most exemption more admission used by extend facto term needing full sufficient are university must other domestic scholarship situation can without financial package an selective include this andor doe universal denoting basis be for student application many very others when jure that aid school increase admitted while given form antitrust effect additionally college funding consider congress adequate often need them until they 2022 afford ample participate entirely year generally of campus which there applicant is 30 set addition but international grant on own merit endowment it source institution regard do some claim different significantly statutory standard usually september state requires loan at a their definition no granted circumstance may being all policy or talent requirement not firstyear repaid and receive meet transfer directly tend united the whereas vary needblind de than to any admit meeting demonstrated back with abide reason through in	College admission policy	policy admission college	Universities_and_colleges
Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Schuette v.

In a 6-2 decision, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause does not prevent states from enacting bans on affirmative action in education. </p><p>The case arose after Michigan voters approved the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which amended the state constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment and public education. In a plurality opinion joined by two other justices, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that the ban on affirmative action was constitutional. Kennedy wrote that ""[t]here is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters."" Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer concurred in the result but filed or joined separate opinions. In her dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the voters of Michigan had ""changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities."" </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1426 Cached time: 20220514105736 Cache expiry: 3600 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [] CPU time usage: 0.222 seconds Real time usage: 0.274 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 6538/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 27491/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 19023/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 6/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 751/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.058/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 1712918/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 249.153 1 -total 85.83% 213.838 1 Template:Infobox_SCOTUS_case 63.86% 159.120 1 Template:Infobox 35.51% 88.476 1 Template:Infobox_US_Supreme_Court_case/courts 25.67% 63.962 224 Template:If_between 17.30% 43.113 1 Template:Short_description 14.14% 35.232 1 Template:Use_mdy_dates 8.03% 19.996 1 Template:Pagetype 7.39% 18.413 5 Template:Main_other 5.38% 13.409 1 Template:SCOTUS_URL_Docket -->"	fourteenth case her 291 v 2014 plurality protection michigan had admission initiative joined by discrimination coalition 62 university civil breyer other from amended minority arose right wa illegal this doe sonia decision clause result for stephen concerning uniquely manner that held voter enacting opinion judiciary amendment scalia disadvantaged defend thomas basic associate rule after approved affirmative two schuette court anthony changed constitutional concurred of prevent action which there precedent is set but separate on political determination landmark 572 employment wrote law state u a no sexbased ban kennedy or public policy dissenting antonin sotomayor not clarence and filed constitution make supreme process justice united the authority race to aside equal commit education racial in	United States Supreme Court case	case state supreme court united	Universities_and_colleges

It was released in 2018 and replaced the former APB (Admission Post-Bac). In 2018, 666,000 high school students registered to Parcoursup in order to apply to an undergraduate program. The following year, the site received applications from approximately 651,000 high school students</p><p>The main objective of the platform was to achieve “meritocracy” as Emmanuel Macron and his government made it a priority. Parcoursup thus replaced the previous system of random drawing between students to implement an examination of each student file. </p><p>However, Parcoursup has suffered a lot of criticism. It is currently being blamed for creating anxiety among students, and being opaque because each university uses its own algorithm to decide which students will be admitted. It has also be blamed for the amount of work it generates within universities. Indeed, Parcoursup allows students to make from 1 to 10 wishes with as many as 20 subwishes for each of them. Hence, undergraduate programs receive far more applications than they used to and some universities can have to consider more than 100,000 student files. This has led to strikes within French universities and contributed to a controversy between left- and right-wing parties. </p>	higher 100000 order us released more between admission party also used by random made allows 651000 university other apply from can wa an “ candidate this currently drawing french designed be for student reorientation application former many will blamed following school each generates admitted place suffered because algorithm among wish high lot previous consider them file however they undergraduate priority far rightwing year of thus received led site decide which ministry both is allocate achieve parcoursup criticism ” 666000 replaced apb own left emmanuel it objective anxiety opaque government studentsthe his wanting creating examination some approximately innovation 2018 meritocracy implement mainly controversy main a contributed being 20 macron within hence 1 10 have and amount receive work research make registered process indeed system the strike than to postbac education program ha subwishes with platform in	Parcoursup is a web service of the French ministry of Research and Education for the assigment to the advanced studies for the graduated students, which substitute, since January 2018, the old assigment system APB.	for graduated student advanced which ministry is service parcoursup old apb assigment and research january web system the to 2018 education since study a french of substitute	Universities_and_colleges

Quadrangle (architecture)	"<p>In architecture, a <b>quadrangle</b> (or colloquially, a <b>quad</b>) is a space or a courtyard, usually rectangular (square or oblong) in plan, the sides of which are entirely or mainly occupied by parts of a large building (or several smaller buildings). The word is probably most closely associated with college or university campus architecture, but quadrangles are also found in other buildings such as palaces. Most quadrangles are open-air, though a few have been roofed over (often with glass), to provide additional space for social meeting areas or coffee shops for students. </p><p>The word <i>quadrangle</i> was originally synonymous with <i>quadrilateral</i>, but this usage is now relatively uncommon.</p> <p>Some modern quadrangles resemble cloister gardens of medieval monasteries, called <i>garths</i>, which were usually square or rectangular, enclosed by covered arcades or cloisters. However, it is clear from the oldest examples (such as Mob Quad) which are plain and unadorned with arcades, that the medieval colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were creating practical accommodation for college members. Grander quadrangles that look like cloisters came later, once the idea of a college was well established and benefactors or founders wished to create more monumental buildings. Although architectonically analogous, for historical reasons quads in the colleges of the University of Cambridge are always referred to as courts (such as the Trinity Great Court). </p><p>In North America, Thomas Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia centered the housing and academic buildings in a Palladian form around three sides of the Lawn, a huge grassy expanse. Later, some American college and university planners imitated the Jeffersonian plan, the Oxbridge idea, Beaux-Arts forms, and other models. All five barracks at The Citadel (military college) feature quadrangles with red-and-white squares (the colors of the South Carolina battle flag), which are used for formations by the Corps of Cadets. </p><p>Quadrangles are also found in traditional Kerala houses (Naalukettu) and is known as the <i>Nadumittam</i> (""Middle Space"").</p>"	plan academic american most house more word square also like used by housing are always look probably oldest large trinity quadrangle additional university other well member social plain from jeffersonian part wa referred this synonymous great medieval mob architecture area over several for smaller were student naalukettu rectangular building usage nadumittam palladian that oxford jefferson later form carolina provide arcade flag college thomas quadrilateral five often courtyard such beauxarts though court cadet however create coffee entirely been of three shop campus practical unadorned which covered middle redandwhite is traditional color but openair now barrack monastery came expanse america south side closely modern it roofed originally relatively around monumental space feature creating oblong some kerala usually oxbridge garden corp at mainly planner citadel grander imitated a accommodation colloquially once in idea all battle found architectonically huge or enclosed example have glass garths and palace established although wished grassy uncommon known founder historical analogous the benefactor resemble quad to called clear cloister virginia centered meeting few lawn with reason cambridge military model associated north occupied formation design	space or courtyard	or courtyard space	Universities_and_colleges
Satellite campus	<p>A <b>satellite campus</b> or <b>branch campus</b> or <b>regional campus</b> is a campus of a university or college that is physically at a distance from the original university or college area. This branch campus may be located in a different city, state, or country, and is often smaller than the main campus of an institution. The separate campuses may or may not be under the same accreditation and share resources or they share administrations but maintain separate budgets, resources, and other governing bodies. </p><p>In many cases, satellite campuses are intended to serve students who cannot travel far from home for college because of family responsibilities, their jobs, financial limitations, or other factors. The availability of branch campuses may increase higher education enrollment by nontraditional students.</p><p>Electronic communications technology has helped to facilitate the operation of satellite campuses. Classes taught at one campus can be transmitted to other locations via distance education, students at branch campuses can access library materials on the main campus electronically, and technology allows institutions to administer registration, admissions, and financial aid transactions remotely.</p><p>One growing trend is the establishment of international branch campuses. These are satellite campuses of a parent institution that is located outside the country where the satellite campus is located. The number of international branch campuses worldwide grew from 35 before 1999 to 162 in 2009, including 78 branches operated by United States universities. As of 2009, the United Arab Emirates was the host of 40 international branch campuses, more than any other nation. There were 15 international branch campuses in China, 12 in Singapore, nine in Qatar, and six in Canada. In addition to the United States, the home countries of institutions with international branches included Australia, whose universities operated a total of 14 international branches; the United Kingdom, with 13 international branches; and France and India, each of whose universities had a total of 11 international branches. Although the overall number of international branch campuses has grown rapidly, a total of 11 such campuses closed between 2004 and 2009.

A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010, and in 2011, it was confirmed that the film would instead be a prequel titled <i>Monsters University</i>.</p><p><i>Monsters University</i> premiered on June 5, 2013 at the BFI Southbank in London, England, and was theatrically released on June 21, 2013, in the United States. It was accompanied in theaters by a short film, <i>The Blue Umbrella</i>, directed by Saschka Unseld. The film received positive reviews from the critics and grossed $743 million worldwide against its $200 million production budget, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2013. An animated short film titled <i>Party Central</i>, which takes place shortly after the events of <i>Monsters University</i>, premiered in fall 2013 before being released theatrically with <i>Muppets Most Wanted</i> in 2014.</p>"	dan graf plan fillion 2014 american order most umbrella released had peter p short walt pete start early time buscemi cast joined by murray purchase budget draft party kori made become music mike slowly 21 saschka university karen l must unit instead version hunt member role who where helen from central alfred ratzenberger right wa pixarmade an stanton bob since mirren steve lasseter unkrich pixar andrew executive 2001 day blue be for picture were accompanied sequel london holder composed off best following that reality 5 production voice school dave produced while debut million goodman written june review place film lee directed inc rival shortly respectively tasked 2006 unseld james college baird rae together along take after robert roz charlie tell learn however grossed they grade reprise scanlon dream southbank peterson collaboration of received circle led character friend 7 confirmed would which before joel is critic bonnie premiered seventh but titled 200 wanted teacher directorial thing universitymonsters on theatrically muppets animated cancellation it 2005 highestgrossing abominable his feature prequel boggs 2010 event fall 2011 monster gerson wazowski voiced studio nathan england state story at randall john main animation new computeranimated a their worldwide conducted producer being bfi comedy kappa sullivan disney newman 2013 and positive disagreement first snowman work billy make crystal serving molina united the against to oozma sohn daniel during docter hayes only developed sean foley m flint ha making randy with 743 theater in	2013 American animated film directed by Dan Scanlon	dan by animated scanlon american film directed 2013	Universities_and_colleges
Greendale Community College	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Community</b></i> is an American television sitcom created by Dan Harmon. The series ran for 110 episodes over six seasons, with its first five seasons airing on NBC from September 17, 2009, to April 17, 2014, and its final season airing on Yahoo! Screen from March 17 to June 2, 2015. Set at a community college in the fictional Colorado town of Greendale, the series stars an ensemble cast consisting of Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Yvette Nicole Brown, Alison Brie, Donald Glover, Ken Jeong, Chevy Chase, and Jim Rash. It makes heavy use of meta-humor and pop culture references, often paying homage to film and television clichés and tropes. </p><p>Harmon based the program on his own experiences attending Glendale Community College. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's ""story circle"" template, a method designed to create effective and structured storytelling. Harmon served as showrunner for the show's first three seasons but was fired prior to the fourth season and replaced by David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth season, after which the series was canceled by NBC; Yahoo! Screen revived the show for what would be <i>Community</i><span>'</span>s sixth and final season. </p><p>Despite struggling in the ratings during its run, <i>Community</i> developed a cult following and received critical acclaim for its acting, direction, and writing, as well as its meta-humor. The series won a Primetime Emmy Award from four nominations and received the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Comedy Series in 2012, among other accolades. Since the series ended, and as recently as 2021, former crew and cast members have expressed interest in a potential film. </p>"	dan rehired ended rating 2014 run american clichés june fictional fifth would cast by writing emmy greendale fan won 17 served primetime well other member from crew series wa jeong an 2015 guarascio mchale trope choice since method effective chevy designed be over struggling town yahoo acclaim for 2009 showrunner acting former best following 2021 potential each written among film ken college alison response moses culture five critical often after consisting structured experience create glendale 110 sitcom donald of three received circle brie six accordance final which star joel is set glover pop critic revived but ran replaced on own template four metahumor april award expressed brown it nicole jim episode fired interest colorado his based danny community september prior story at march television cult paying a use created comedy harmons jacob nomination pudi have reference and 2012 first harmon sixth 2 make yvette rash attending fourth ensemble nbc gillian the canceled to lukewarm storytelling season david during homage direction despite airing port show chase developed what heavy program with recently screen accolade in	American comedy television series created by Dan Harmon	dan comedy harmon television by american created series	Universities_and_colleges
